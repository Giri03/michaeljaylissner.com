							  		<h3>Biography</h3>
							  		<p>This is the latest (and more concise, less Leo Tolstoy) version of the Michael Lissner's biography. The <a href="http://www.michaeljaylissner.com/archive/biography.html">last version</a> was written in September 2005.</p>

							  		<p><strong>10 November 2006</strong></p>
							  		<p>Michael Jay Lissner was born to parents David and Katharine Lissner on June 9th, 1982. He was his mom's third;
							  		his father's second child. His two siblings from his mother, were a boy and a girl. James, his older brother was
							  		about seven years his elder; his sister, Jessica, was about three when he was born.</p>

							  		<p>Michael spent the first few years of his life growing in up La Crescenta, a suburb of Los Angeles. He was obsessed
							  		with Legos, did well in elementary school, had unusually wide feet, broke his right arm once, and was otherwise pretty
							  		uneventful.</p>

							  		<p>Around the time that he was completing elementary school in La Cresenta, his father, David moved the family
							  		company down to Mexico, where he believed it would be better able to grow without the constant threat of lawsuits and false
							  		insurance claims from factory workers. As a result, the Lissner family moved to a wealthy suburb of San Diego, Coronado, where
							  		David could easily commute to work, and the children could get one of the best public educations possible.</p>

							  		<p>It was in Coronado that Michael would truly grow up, as it was there that he lived during the formative ages of 12 through 18.
							  		While in Coronado, Michael had many hobbies, and was truly a busy person. For years he loved roller blading, and rode his "blades"
							  		for miles and miles every day. When that got old, he began training for a road bike race that was to never quite come together.
							  		After that, he become very involved in woodworking, a hobby that was inspired by his father's teaching him about carpentry, and
							  		one which would absorb more time than many other of his hobbies combined. For a sampling of the projects that he worked on, try
							  		the <a href="pics/index.htm">pictures section</a>.</p>

							  		<p>All while he was doing all of the above activities, he was regularly attending Boy Scout meetings, (where he would eventually get
							  		his Eagle), playing for one or two soccer teams, and getting pretty good grades in school. He broke his right arm a second time, cut
							  		open his hand with a hatchet for eight stitches, cut open his knee for 40, but was otherwise fairly uneventful.</p>

							  		<p>After finishing up High School, Michael was accepted to <a href="http://www.pitzer.edu">Pitzer College</a>, a small liberal arts school outside of Los Angeles, and
							       at the end of the summer of 2000, he moved up there, where he would spend the next four years of his life. While at Pitzer, Michael
							       took a number of different classes, ranging from neuroscience to C++ programming language.</p>

									<p>His great interest though while enrolled at Pitzer turned out to be politics. By the time he graduated, he was simultaneously a member of
									upwards of a dozen policy setting committees, had meetings every day of the week, had been dorm president for several years, had helped to create a fourth
									meal in the dining hall, had secured the free art policy for future students, and had influenced policy in as many areas as he could find
									the time. It kept him busy, and more interestingly, he suffered no major injuries to his body during this time aside from one chipped bone in his ankle and several
									rolled ankles.</p>

									<p>After graduating from Pitzer, Michael moved to Berkeley and began working for his dad selling <a href="http://www.benchpro.com">the company</a> product, workbenches. He
									worked as an inside salesman and learned a very important lesson - He's not very good at sales. However, the job was not all bad - he worked from
									home, gained knowledge of the inner workings of sales, and made a decent wage, which he carefully saved for an upcoming trip that he had been
									planning since his junior year at Pitzer College.</p>

									<p>After working for his dad for about a year, he resigned and took the money he saved and walked about 2,600 miles from Mexico to Canada via the
									<a href="http://www.pcta.org">Pacific Crest Trail</a>. It was a life changing event, that took about five months to complete, and
									involved walking over 100 marathons. Much time was spent thinking about life and death, motivations, happiness and the like. Mostly though his mind
									was at ease, thinking of nothing at all (see the <a href="pics">pictures section</a> for more on that). Upon arriving at Canada, Michael had suffered
									almost no injuries, and promptly did his best to get back into the mainstream society.</p>

									<p>The first step in this process was to shave his five-month beard and get a job. The job he was to find was for <a href="http://www.co.contra-costa.ca.us/depart/service/index1.html">Contra Costa County Community Services
									Department</a>, where he currently works running state and federal reports, reworking spreadsheets and doing general admistration tasks.</p>
