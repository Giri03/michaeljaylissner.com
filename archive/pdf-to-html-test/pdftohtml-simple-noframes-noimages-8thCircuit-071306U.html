PER CURIAM.<br>
On remand from&nbsp;a prior appeal, the district court1&nbsp;sentenced Wilson at the<br>
bottom&nbsp;of an uncontested Sentencing Guidelines Range of 360 months to life for a<br>
Hobbs Act robbery. &nbsp;18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). &nbsp;In&nbsp;addition, the district court imposed a<br>
mandatory, consecutive 84-month sentence under § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), bringing<br>
Wilson’s total sentence to 444 months’ imprisonment. &nbsp;This sentence was identical to<br>
that of his co-defendant in the robbery&nbsp;who had a less extensive criminal history.<br>
1The Honorable Linda R. Reade, Chief Judge, United States District Court for<br>
the Northern District of Iowa.<br>
<hr>
<A name=2></a>Wilson appealed his sentence under United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220<br>
(2005), and we affirmed. &nbsp;Less than one month later, the Supreme Court issued its<br>
opinion in Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38 (2007), holding that, in the absence of<br>
procedural error, courts of appeals are&nbsp;to review the substantive reasonableness of<br>
sentences for abuse of discretion. &nbsp;The&nbsp;Court subsequently granted certiorari in<br>
Wilson's case, vacated our judgment, and remanded for reconsideration in light of<br>
Gall. &nbsp;On remand, the parties have filed&nbsp;supplemental briefs, and we now affirm.<br>
The&nbsp;district court properly calculated the&nbsp;advisory&nbsp;Guidelines range, considered<br>
the relevant factors of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), considered the relevant individual<br>
circumstances of Wilson's situation, considered his arguments in support of a variance<br>
below the advisory Guidelines&nbsp;range, and considered no irrelevant factors. &nbsp;In doing<br>
so, the district court noted Wilson's extensive criminal history&nbsp;and&nbsp;the absence of<br>
meaningful reasons to distinguish his situation from&nbsp;that of his co-defendant.<br>
The district court's within-range sentence is presumptively reasonable, Rita v.<br>
United States, 551 U.S. 338, 347–48 (2007), and we&nbsp;find nothing to overcome that<br>
presumption in the present case. &nbsp;Wilson argues that the maximum&nbsp;sentence under<br>
Iowa law for an analogous crime is substantially shorter and that, based on his age, the<br>
444-month sentence is essentially a life sentence.&nbsp; &nbsp;The district court was aware of his<br>
age and did not abuse its discretion in rejecting his argument. &nbsp;Further, we have held<br>
post-Booker&nbsp;that an arguable discrepancy between state and federal sentences for<br>
similarly situated defendants is not an&nbsp;appropriate consideration under § 3553(a).<br>
United States v. Jeremiah, 446 F.3d 805, 808 (8th Cir. 2006).&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the advisory<br>
range, Wilson's extensive criminal history, and his demonstrated dangerous<br>
propensities, it is clear that the district court did not abuse its discretion.&nbsp;<br>
We affirm&nbsp;the judgment of the district court.<br>
