&nbsp;<br>Opinion for the court filed by&nbsp;<i>Circuit Judge</i>&nbsp;BROWN.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
BROWN,&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Circuit Judge</i>: Samuel Vinton, convicted of&nbsp;<br>
narcotics and firearm&nbsp;offenses&nbsp;after the contraband was found&nbsp;<br>in a briefcase in his car during a traffic stop, appeals the&nbsp;<br>denial of his motion to suppress. &nbsp;He argues the evidence was&nbsp;<br>discovered during an unconstitutional search of his vehicle&nbsp;<br>and property. &nbsp;In particular, he contends that&nbsp;<i>Arizona v. Gant</i>,&nbsp;<br>129 S. Ct. 1710 (2009), decided by the Supreme&nbsp;Court while&nbsp;<br>this appeal&nbsp;was pending, establishes that&nbsp;the search&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>briefcase cannot be upheld under&nbsp;the search-incident-to-arrest&nbsp;<br>exception to the warrant requirement. &nbsp;Because it was&nbsp;<br>“reasonable to believe” evidence relevant&nbsp;to Vinton’s&nbsp;<br>weapons-possession offense&nbsp;would be found inside the&nbsp;<br>briefcase, we&nbsp;affirm.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
On September 9, 2006, around 9:00 p.m., U.S. Park&nbsp;<br>
Police Officer William&nbsp;Alton, driving a marked cruiser in&nbsp;<br>Southeast D.C., saw a green Nissan Maxima&nbsp;speeding, and&nbsp;<br>also observed that its windows were excessively tinted. &nbsp;Tr. of&nbsp;<br>Mot. Hr’g at 6, 8, 69,&nbsp;<i>United States v. Vinton</i>, No. 06-cr-298&nbsp;<br>(D.D.C. Feb. 9, 2007) (Suppression&nbsp;Tr.). &nbsp;As Alton followed&nbsp;<br>the car, he&nbsp;noticed “a thin blue line&nbsp;sticker on&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;<br>[the] car,” which Alton assumed referred to the driver’s&nbsp;<br>probable affiliation with law enforcement, most likely&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 8, 70.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
The driver promptly obeyed Alton’s signal to pull over&nbsp;<br>
and, as Alton approached the car, the driver, Vinton, lowered&nbsp;<br>all his windows. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 10, 70. &nbsp;Alton asked if Vinton was in&nbsp;<br>law enforcement and Vinton said&nbsp;he worked in “personal&nbsp;<br>security.” &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 11, 71. &nbsp;Alton immediately saw&nbsp;a knife with&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=3></a>3&nbsp;<br>
a five-and-a-half inch sheath on Vinton’s backseat, in “close&nbsp;<br>proximity” to Vinton, easily within reaching-distance. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<br>11–12, 25, 37, 70–71. &nbsp;Vinton explained the knife was used&nbsp;<br>when fishing with his grandfather, but Alton saw no other&nbsp;<br>fishing equipment in the car. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 12, 14, 71. &nbsp;He retrieved&nbsp;<br>the knife and placed it on the roof of the car, “out of arm’s&nbsp;<br>reach of the driver.” &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 14, 71. &nbsp;Alton asked if there were&nbsp;<br>“any other weapons in the vehicle,” and Vinton responded&nbsp;<br>“no, he . . . ke[pt] that part of his trade at home.” &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 14,&nbsp;<br>71. &nbsp;Alton then measured the car’s windows with a tint meter&nbsp;<br>and determined they exceeded D.C.’s seventy-percent tint&nbsp;<br>limit. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 15–17, 71. &nbsp;He returned to&nbsp;his cruiser&nbsp;to prepare a&nbsp;<br>citation. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 17, 72.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
Officer Alton was working&nbsp;alone and had not called for&nbsp;<br>
Park Police backup. &nbsp;However, when an MPD officer&nbsp;<br>appeared,&nbsp;Alton “asked&nbsp;him&nbsp;to&nbsp;stop” because he had found a&nbsp;<br>large knife and desired assistance in conducting a protective&nbsp;<br>search of the car. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 19–20, 72. &nbsp;The officer told Alton&nbsp;<br>there had been a double-stabbing homicide in the same&nbsp;<br>vicinity approximately&nbsp;twenty hours earlier. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 20, 72.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Alton told Vinton he was going to conduct a search for&nbsp;<br>weapons and asked twice more&nbsp;whether there were any&nbsp;<br>weapons in the car; Vinton first responded “no” but then&nbsp;<br>responded, “not that I know of.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 22, 73. &nbsp;Alton&nbsp;<br>removed Vinton from the car and handcuffed him,&nbsp;but&nbsp;<br>informed him&nbsp;he was not under arrest. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 22, 73. &nbsp;A search&nbsp;<br>of the passenger compartment of the car revealed two cans of&nbsp;<br>mace in the front armrest, a “butterfly knife” under the front&nbsp;<br>passenger-side floor mat, a bag of Styrofoam&nbsp;earplugs, and a&nbsp;<br>locked briefcase on the backseat. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 23–24, 26, 73–74.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Vinton claimed he used the earplugs as sleeping aids and said&nbsp;<br>the briefcase did not belong to&nbsp;him&nbsp;and he was unaware of its&nbsp;<br>contents. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 26, 74. &nbsp;Officer Alton phoned headquarters to&nbsp;<br>request guidance on how to proceed, and U.S. Park Police&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

Investigator Hodge arrived shortly thereafter. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 25–27,&nbsp;<br>74. &nbsp;Alton briefed him&nbsp;on the stop and Hodge conferred with&nbsp;<br>a Park Police supervisor to assess whether Alton had probable&nbsp;<br>cause to make an arrest.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 27. &nbsp;They determined that he&nbsp;<br>did. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
After placing Vinton under arrest for “possession of a&nbsp;<br>
prohibited weapon,” Officer Alton pried open the locked&nbsp;<br>briefcase. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 27, 29, 74–75. &nbsp;Inside, he found three bags of&nbsp;<br>ecstasy, three pistol&nbsp;magazines,&nbsp;a “fighting knife . . . like&nbsp;<br>brass knuckles,” and a .45 caliber semiautomatic pistol,&nbsp;<br>cocked and loaded. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 29, 75.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
Vinton was charged in a two-count indictment with&nbsp;<br>
unlawful possession with intent&nbsp;to distribute ecstasy, 21&nbsp;<br>U.S.C. § 841; and using, carrying and possessing a firearm&nbsp;<br>during a drug trafficking offense,&nbsp;18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1). &nbsp;He&nbsp;<br>moved to suppress all of the tangible evidence recovered, and&nbsp;<br>all of his statements made, during the traffic stop. &nbsp;Following&nbsp;<br>a hearing, the district court denied the motion. &nbsp;Mem.&nbsp;Op.,&nbsp;<br><i>United States v. Vinton</i>, No. 06-cr-298 (Feb. 12, 2007).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Vinton was convicted by a jury of both counts and was&nbsp;<br>sentenced to twenty-seven months’ imprisonment on the first&nbsp;<br>count and sixty months’ on the second count, to run&nbsp;<br>consecutively, as well as&nbsp;three years’ supervised release. &nbsp;He&nbsp;<br>brings this appeal arguing his motion to suppress was&nbsp;<br>erroneously denied.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
We review “determinations of&nbsp;reasonable suspicion and&nbsp;<br>
probable cause . . .&nbsp;<i>de novo</i>” but “review findings of historical&nbsp;<br>fact only for clear error and . . .&nbsp;give&nbsp;due weight to inferences&nbsp;<br>drawn from those facts&nbsp;by” the district court.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ornelas v.&nbsp;<br>United States</i>, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996).&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Fourth Amendment guarantees “[t]he right of the&nbsp;<br>
people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and&nbsp;<br>effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” &nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;<br>CONST. amend. IV. &nbsp;“Time&nbsp;and again, [the Supreme] Court&nbsp;<br>has observed that searches and&nbsp;seizures conducted outside the&nbsp;<br>judicial process, without&nbsp;prior approval by judge or&nbsp;<br>magistrate,&nbsp;are&nbsp;<i>per se</i>&nbsp;unreasonable under the Fourth&nbsp;<br>Amendment—subject only to a&nbsp;few specifically established&nbsp;<br>and well delineated exceptions.” &nbsp;<i>Minnesota v. Dickerson</i>,&nbsp;<br>508 U.S. 366, 372 (1993). &nbsp;The government relies on several&nbsp;<br>exceptions in urging us to&nbsp;uphold the denial of Vinton’s&nbsp;<br>motion to suppress. &nbsp;We will address each issue in sequence:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Did Officer Alton have&nbsp;the right to search&nbsp;the passenger&nbsp;<br>compartment of Vinton’s car? &nbsp;Following this&nbsp;search, was&nbsp;<br>Vinton properly arrested?&nbsp; Was the search of&nbsp;the briefcase&nbsp;<br>permissible?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
A&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Supreme Court has long “recognized that traffic&nbsp;<br>
stops are especially fraught with danger to police officers”&nbsp;<br>and that the “risk of harm to&nbsp;both the police and the occupants&nbsp;<br>[of a stopped vehicle] is minimized if the officers routinely&nbsp;<br>exercise unquestioned command of the situation.” &nbsp;<i>Arizona v.&nbsp;<br>Johnson</i>, 129 S. Ct. 781, 786 (2009)&nbsp;(internal quotation marks&nbsp;<br>and citations&nbsp;omitted) (alteration in&nbsp;original). &nbsp;Thus, during a&nbsp;<br>traffic stop, in order “to allow the officer to pursue his&nbsp;<br>investigation without&nbsp;fear of violence,”&nbsp;<i>Adams v. Williams</i>,&nbsp;<br>407 U.S. 143, 146 (1972), the officer may order the driver out&nbsp;<br>of his car and may search the passenger compartment of the&nbsp;<br>car for weapons if the officer develops a reasonable suspicion&nbsp;<br>that the driver is “dangerous&nbsp;and . . . may gain immediate&nbsp;<br>control of weapons”&nbsp;inside the car. &nbsp;<i>Michigan v. Long</i>, 463&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

U.S. 1032, 1049 (1983) (citing&nbsp;<i>Terry&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Ohio</i>, 392 U.S. 1, 21&nbsp;<br>(1968)) (footnote omitted);&nbsp;<i>see</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pennsylvania v.&nbsp;Mimms</i>, 434&nbsp;<br>U.S. 106, 111 n.6 (1977) (per curiam). &nbsp;Courts assess “the&nbsp;<br>totality&nbsp;of&nbsp;the circumstances .&nbsp;. .&nbsp;to&nbsp;see whether&nbsp;the&nbsp;detaining&nbsp;<br>officer ha[d] a particularized and objective basis” for&nbsp;<br>suspecting the driver was armed and dangerous,&nbsp;<br>acknowledging that the&nbsp;“likelihood of criminal activity need&nbsp;<br>not rise to the level required&nbsp;for probable cause, and it falls&nbsp;<br>considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the&nbsp;<br>evidence standard.” &nbsp;<i>United States v. Arvizu</i>, 534 U.S. 266,&nbsp;<br>273–74 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
Here, the facts that&nbsp;accumulated within the first few&nbsp;<br>
moments of the traffic stop established a particularized and&nbsp;<br>objective basis for suspecting&nbsp;Vinton might be armed and&nbsp;<br>dangerous. &nbsp;As an initial matter, Vinton does not argue that&nbsp;<br>Officer Alton had an insufficient basis for pulling him&nbsp;over.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Indeed, it is&nbsp;clear that Vinton was properly&nbsp;stopped because&nbsp;<br>Officer Alton’s firsthand observations gave him&nbsp;probable&nbsp;<br>cause to believe that Vinton had been speeding and driving&nbsp;<br>with windows tinted in excess&nbsp;of&nbsp;the legal limit. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;<br>Suppression Tr. at 8, 69;&nbsp;<i>Whren v. United States</i>, 517 U.S.&nbsp;<br>806, 810 (1996).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
Most crucially, upon approaching Vinton’s car, Officer&nbsp;<br>
Alton saw a knife with a five-and-a-half-inch sheath in plain&nbsp;<br>view on the backseat,&nbsp;easily within reaching-distance of&nbsp;<br>Vinton. &nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Suppression Tr. at 11–12, 25, 37, 70. &nbsp;“[T]he&nbsp;<br>presence of one weapon may justifiably arouse concern that&nbsp;<br>there may be more in the vicinity.” &nbsp;<i>United States v.&nbsp;<br>Christian</i>, 187 F.3d 663, 669 (D.C. Cir. 1999). &nbsp;For instance,&nbsp;<br>in&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Long</i>, the Supreme Court held that after the officers&nbsp;<br>observed “a large knife in the interior of&nbsp;the&nbsp;car,” they were&nbsp;<br>justified in “conduct[ing] an&nbsp;area search of the passenger&nbsp;<br>compartment” of the car “to ensure that there were no other&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=7></a>7&nbsp;<br>
weapons” in “those areas to which Long would generally&nbsp;<br>have immediate control.” &nbsp;463&nbsp;U.S. at 1050–51. &nbsp;Similarly, in&nbsp;<br><i>Christian</i>,&nbsp;we held&nbsp;that because the officer “saw [a] dagger in&nbsp;<br>plain view” when he “arrived at&nbsp;Christian’s car,” he “had&nbsp;<br>sufficient indication Christian might be armed and dangerous&nbsp;<br>to justify a protective search for weapons.” &nbsp;187 F.3d at 669.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Like the defendants in&nbsp;<i>Long</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Christian</i>, Vinton possessed&nbsp;<br>in plain view a knife capable of&nbsp;being used to cause serious&nbsp;<br>bodily harm. &nbsp;Although Officer Alton removed this knife and&nbsp;<br>placed it out of arm’s reach on the roof of Vinton’s car, he&nbsp;<br>was justifiably concerned that&nbsp;additional weapons might be&nbsp;<br>hidden elsewhere in the vicinity.&nbsp;&nbsp;This concern was not abated&nbsp;<br>by ordering Vinton out of the car and handcuffing him,&nbsp;<br>because had&nbsp;Vinton ultimately not been arrested, he would&nbsp;<br>have been “permitted to reenter his automobile, and he&nbsp;<br>w[ould] then have [had] access to any weapons inside.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>Long</i>, 463 U.S. at 1052.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
We reject Vinton’s argument&nbsp;that&nbsp;while a dagger may&nbsp;<br>
justify a protective search&nbsp;for additional weapons,&nbsp;<i>see&nbsp;<br>Christian</i>, 187 F.3d at 669, a sheathed knife like Vinton’s&nbsp;<br>may not. &nbsp;“[A]&nbsp;<i>Terry</i>&nbsp;investigation . . . involves a police&nbsp;<br>investigation at close range, when the officer remains&nbsp;<br>particularly vulnerable . . . [and]&nbsp;must make a quick decision&nbsp;<br>as to how to protect himself and others from&nbsp;possible danger.” &nbsp;<br><i>Long</i>, 463 U.S. at 1052 (internal quotation marks and citation&nbsp;<br>omitted).&nbsp; Officer Alton&nbsp;did not have&nbsp;time to perform&nbsp;a close&nbsp;<br>inspection of Vinton’s sheathed&nbsp;knife&nbsp;to determine precisely&nbsp;<br>how dangerous it was. &nbsp;Nor&nbsp;was Officer Alton required to&nbsp;<br>accept Vinton’s claim&nbsp;that he used the knife only for fishing&nbsp;<br>with his grandfather. &nbsp;For one, Alton observed no other&nbsp;<br>fishing equipment in the car that&nbsp;might have corroborated this&nbsp;<br>story. &nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;</i>Suppression Tr. at 14, 71.&nbsp;&nbsp;But regardless, even a&nbsp;<br>lawfully-possessed fishing knife can be used as a dangerous&nbsp;<br>weapon. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Long</i>, 463 U.S. at 1052 n.16 (holding that&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=8></a>8&nbsp;<br>
possession of lawful&nbsp;hunting knife contributed&nbsp;to reasonable&nbsp;<br>suspicion&nbsp;that driver&nbsp;was armed and dangerous). &nbsp;Moreover,&nbsp;<br>there was an additional reason for viewing Vinton’s&nbsp;<br>explanations with skepticism. &nbsp;The “thin blue line sticker” on&nbsp;<br>the back of his car,&nbsp;<i>see</i>&nbsp;Suppression Tr. at 8, 70—which, as&nbsp;<br>Vinton concedes, “suggested&nbsp;a connection with law&nbsp;<br>enforcement,” Appellant’s Br. 36—could have been viewed&nbsp;<br>as a deliberate attempt to create the false impression&nbsp;that&nbsp;<br>Vinton was affiliated with law enforcement. &nbsp;Furthermore,&nbsp;<br>while Alton’s newly-acquired knowledge of a recent double-<br>stabbing homicide in the same&nbsp;neighborhood,&nbsp;<i>see&nbsp;</i>Suppression&nbsp;<br>Tr. at 20, 72, was not itself sufficient to justify the protective&nbsp;<br>search, it added to the circumstances warranting Alton’s&nbsp;<br>decision to search the car to ensure his own safety.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>Finally, Vinton’s argument that Officer Alton did not&nbsp;<br>
subjectively believe Vinton was dangerous may easily be&nbsp;<br>rejected.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;“[t]he Fourth Amendment test is&nbsp;<br>objective,” an officer’s&nbsp;“actual subjective motives . . . are&nbsp;<br>irrelevant&nbsp;to&nbsp;the Fourth&nbsp;Amendment analysis&nbsp;of&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;traffic&nbsp;<br>stop and protective search of the car.” &nbsp;<i>United States v.&nbsp;<br>Washington</i>, 559 F.3d 573, 575 (D.C. Cir. 2009). &nbsp;Of course,&nbsp;<br>it was possible that Vinton used&nbsp;his sheathed knife only for&nbsp;<br>fishing, that he had benign reasons for having excessively&nbsp;<br>tinted windows, and that his “thin blue line” sticker was not&nbsp;<br>meant to be misleading. &nbsp;But “[a] determination that&nbsp;<br>reasonable suspicion exists .&nbsp;. . need not rule out the&nbsp;<br>possibility of innocent conduct.” &nbsp;<i>Arvizu</i>, 534 U.S. at 277.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Examining the totality&nbsp;of&nbsp;the circumstances&nbsp;objectively,&nbsp;<br>Officer Alton had a reasonable&nbsp;belief, based on specific and&nbsp;<br>articulable facts, that Vinton was armed and dangerous. &nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;<br>Long</i>, 463 U.S. at 1049. &nbsp;Thus, he properly searched the&nbsp;<br>passenger compartment of Vinton’s car for additional&nbsp;<br>weapons.&nbsp;<br>

“[A] warrantless arrest&nbsp;by&nbsp;a law officer is reasonable&nbsp;<br>
under the Fourth Amendment where there is probable cause&nbsp;<br>to believe&nbsp;that a criminal offense has been or is being&nbsp;<br>committed.” &nbsp;<i>Devenpeck v. Alford</i>, 543 U.S. 146, 152 (2004).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>“There is no precise formula for the probability required for&nbsp;<br>probable cause. &nbsp;Somewhere between ‘less than evidence&nbsp;<br>which would justify . . . conviction’ and ‘more than bare&nbsp;<br>suspicion,’ probable cause is satisfied. . . . The precise point is&nbsp;<br>indeterminate. . . . The standard is to be met by applying a&nbsp;<br>totality-of-the-circumstances analysis.” &nbsp;<i>United States v.&nbsp;<br>Riley</i>, 351 F.3d 1265, 1267 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal&nbsp;<br>quotation marks omitted). &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
In the course of searching Vinton’s car for weapons,&nbsp;<br>
Officer Alton found, among other&nbsp;things, a “butterfly knife”&nbsp;<br>hidden under the passenger-side floor mat. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Suppression&nbsp;<br>Tr. at 23, 73. &nbsp;Vinton was eventually arrested for “possession&nbsp;<br>of a prohibited weapon” (PPW), D.C. Code § 22-4514(b).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>However, because the offense&nbsp;of PPW&nbsp;requires “proof of&nbsp;<br>intent&nbsp;to&nbsp;use&nbsp;[the weapon]&nbsp;<i>unlawfully</i>&nbsp;against another,”&nbsp;<i>United&nbsp;<br>States v. Broadie</i>, 452 F.3d 875, 881 (D.C. Cir. 2006)&nbsp;<br>(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted),&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>government has conceded that Officer Alton lacked probable&nbsp;<br>cause to arrest for PPW. &nbsp;The government nonetheless argues&nbsp;<br>the arrest was valid because&nbsp;there was probable cause to&nbsp;<br>believe&nbsp;Vinton committed the offense of “carrying&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>dangerous weapon” (CDW), D.C. Code § 22-4504(a), which&nbsp;<br>“does not require proof&nbsp;of intent to use the weapon for an&nbsp;<br>unlawful purpose,”&nbsp;<i>Broadie</i>, 452 F.3d at 881. &nbsp;Because the&nbsp;<br>Fourth Amendment inquiry is objective, an officer’s&nbsp;<br>“subjective reason for making the arrest need not be the&nbsp;<br>criminal offense as to which the known facts provide&nbsp;<br>probable cause.” &nbsp;<i>Devenpeck</i>, 543 U.S. at 153;&nbsp;<i>see also</i>&nbsp;<br>

<A name=10></a>10&nbsp;<br>
<i>Broadie</i>, 452 F.3d at 881 (holding&nbsp;arrest was valid because&nbsp;<br>there was probable cause of&nbsp;CDW, even though officer&nbsp;<br>incorrectly believed at&nbsp;the time&nbsp;that he had probable cause of&nbsp;<br>PPW).&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>The CDW&nbsp;statute prohibits “carry[ing]&nbsp;within the District&nbsp;<br>
of Columbia&nbsp;either openly or concealed on or&nbsp;about their&nbsp;<br>person . . . any deadly or dangerous weapon.” &nbsp;D.C. Code §&nbsp;<br>22-4504(a). &nbsp;As we have explained, under District of&nbsp;<br>Columbia case law, a “deadly or dangerous weapon” is&nbsp;<br>“anything that is ‘<i>likely</i>&nbsp;to produce death or great bodily&nbsp;<br>injury&nbsp;by the use&nbsp;made of it.’” &nbsp;<i>Broadie</i>, 452 F.3d at 881&nbsp;<br>(quoting&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Strong v. United States</i>, 581 A.2d 383, 386 (D.C.&nbsp;<br>1990)). &nbsp;Two categories of objects are likely to produce such&nbsp;<br>harm: (1) those that are “inherently dangerous,”&nbsp;<i>i.e.</i>, where&nbsp;<br>“the design of the object is such&nbsp;that&nbsp;in&nbsp;its ordinary use it is&nbsp;<br>likely to cause great bodily injury”; and (2) those&nbsp;that&nbsp;<br>ostensibly may be “used as a tool in certain trades or hobbies&nbsp;<br>or . . . may be carried for utilitarian&nbsp;reasons,” but where “the&nbsp;<br>surrounding circumstances indicate” that “the purpose of&nbsp;<br>carrying the object . . . is its use as a weapon.” &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 882&nbsp;<br>(quoting&nbsp;<i>Strong</i>, 581 A.2d at 386;&nbsp;<i>Scott v.

“A butterfly&nbsp;knife&nbsp;has a split metal handle which&nbsp;encases&nbsp;<br>

record does not establish&nbsp;that&nbsp;butterfly knives are “inherently&nbsp;<br>dangerous,” and indeed, one can&nbsp;imagine they might be used&nbsp;<br>for sport or entertainment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the surrounding&nbsp;<br>circumstances provided Officer&nbsp;Alton with probable cause to&nbsp;<br>believe Vinton intended to use&nbsp;this knife as a dangerous&nbsp;<br>weapon. &nbsp;<i>See Lewis v. United States</i>, 767 A.2d 219, 222 (D.C.&nbsp;<br>2001) (explaining that where the knife possessed by the&nbsp;<br>defendant is not inherently dangerous, “the government must&nbsp;<br>prove beyond a reasonable doubt that . . . the purpose of&nbsp;<br>carrying the instrument was its&nbsp;use as a dangerous weapon”).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
The design of a butterfly knife&nbsp;makes it principally useful&nbsp;<br>
as an easily concealable and quickly deployable weapon&nbsp;<br>capable of injuring another person in an altercation at close&nbsp;<br>range. &nbsp;<i>See, e.g.</i>,&nbsp;<i>Taylor v. United States</i>, 848 F.2d 715, 716,&nbsp;<br>720 (6th Cir. 1988) (butterfly knives are “most often&nbsp;<br>associated with the martial arts and with combat&nbsp;. . . [and are]&nbsp;<br>potentially dangerous, lethal”&nbsp;weapons that “can be opened&nbsp;<br>very rapidly, perhaps in less than 5 seconds” (internal&nbsp;<br>quotation marks omitted));&nbsp;<i>United States v. Stroman</i>, No.&nbsp;<br>Crim. 05-66-P-S, 2006 WL 83404,&nbsp;at *14 (D. Me. Jan. 9,&nbsp;<br>2006) (To deploy a butterfly knife,&nbsp;“[t]he wielder releases one&nbsp;<br>of the halves of the handle&nbsp;and through a combination of&nbsp;<br>gravity and centrifugal force, the latter generated by a&nbsp;<br>movement of&nbsp;the arm&nbsp;or wrist, the wielder swings that half of&nbsp;<br>the handle around until it meets&nbsp;the other half. &nbsp;These forces&nbsp;<br>also swing the&nbsp;<i>blade</i>&nbsp;into position.” (internal quotation marks&nbsp;<br>omitted)). &nbsp;Vinton never offered Officer Alton any&nbsp;<br>explanation whatsoever for his&nbsp;possession of this knife, and&nbsp;<br>certainly, he never suggested he&nbsp;was specially trained&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<br>use of butterfly knives for sport or entertainment purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Thus, Officer Alton was entitled to rely on his common-sense&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>only one&nbsp;blade, and&nbsp;because both parties agree on&nbsp;this point,&nbsp;our&nbsp;<br>analysis assumes&nbsp;the knife&nbsp;had only&nbsp;one blade.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>See id.</i>&nbsp;at 23, 76–<br>77.&nbsp;<br>

assessment that Vinton probably&nbsp;intended to use the knife for&nbsp;<br>its most obvious purpose, fighting. &nbsp;<i>Cf. Broadie</i>, 452 F.3d at&nbsp;<br>882–83 (explaining that although&nbsp;an ASP baton is not&nbsp;<br>inherently dangerous, “the normal and the only apparent use&nbsp;<br>of an ASP baton . . . is to&nbsp;strike another” and that “a&nbsp;<br>reasonable officer surely would believe&nbsp;that a civilian,&nbsp;<br>presumably without police training, would likely inflict great&nbsp;<br>bodily injury when using [one]”). &nbsp;If anything, Vinton’s stated&nbsp;<br>profession—personal security—along with his allusion to&nbsp;<br>possessing weapons at home&nbsp;increased the likelihood that he&nbsp;<br>carried the butterfly knife for use as a weapon. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;<br>Suppression Tr. at 11, 14, 71. &nbsp;That he may have planned to&nbsp;<br>use the knife&nbsp;only in self-defense or defense&nbsp;of another is&nbsp;<br>irrelevant, so long as he intended to use it as a weapon. &nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;<br>Broadie</i>, 452 F.3d at 881 (“[N]either self-defense nor any&nbsp;<br>other ‘lawful purpose’ is material&nbsp;to the offense or sufficient&nbsp;<br>to avoid liability [for CDW].” (citing&nbsp;<i>Monroe v. United&nbsp;<br>States</i>, 598 A.2d 439, 440 (D.C. 1991))).2&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>In addition, the knife was&nbsp;hidden under the floor mat.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<i>See&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Suppression Tr. at 23, 73. &nbsp;Vinton’s various&nbsp;<br>explanations—that maybe the&nbsp;knife&nbsp;fell inadvertently&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br>landed under the mat, or&nbsp;perhaps it was stashed under the mat&nbsp;<br>to prevent passersby from&nbsp;being&nbsp;enticed to&nbsp;break into the car&nbsp;<br>to steal it—are, of course, possible.&nbsp; But Officer Alton&nbsp;was&nbsp;<br>not unreasonable in believing that the likeliest explanation for&nbsp;<br>the knife’s concealment was that&nbsp;Vinton intended to use it as&nbsp;<br>a weapon and therefore wanted to&nbsp;hide it from police officers&nbsp;<br>and potential adversaries. &nbsp;Furthermore, Vinton lied about the&nbsp;<br>knife’s existence. &nbsp;Officer Alton asked Vinton three times&nbsp;<br>whether there were any weapons&nbsp;in the car other than the&nbsp;<br>sheathed knife, and each time Vinton responded in the&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>2&nbsp;Vinton has not argued that the&nbsp;CDW&nbsp;statute is unconstitutional.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Therefore, we have no&nbsp;occasion to address the issue and our&nbsp;<br>holding expresses no view&nbsp;on it.&nbsp;<br>

negative. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>id.</i>&nbsp;at 14, 22, 71, 73. &nbsp;This lack of candor&nbsp;<br>reasonably suggested to Officer&nbsp;Alton that Vinton intended to&nbsp;<br>use the&nbsp;butterfly knife for malicious purposes. &nbsp;Thus, the&nbsp;<br>totality of&nbsp;the circumstances provided probable cause to&nbsp;<br>believe Vinton was carrying a “deadly or dangerous weapon”&nbsp;<br>in violation of D.C. Code § 22-4504(a).&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>Finally, Vinton argues that any finding of probable cause&nbsp;<br>
must be struck down because the facts supporting probable&nbsp;<br>cause were uncovered only after unlawfully extending the&nbsp;<br><i>Terry</i>&nbsp;stop beyond a reasonable duration. &nbsp;“[A] search which&nbsp;<br>is reasonable at its inception may violate the Fourth&nbsp;<br>Amendment&nbsp;by virtue of its intolerable intensity and scope.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>Terry</i>, 392 U.S. at 18. &nbsp;To “assess[]&nbsp;whether a detention is too&nbsp;<br>long in duration to be&nbsp;justified as an investigative stop, we . . .&nbsp;<br>examine whether the police diligently pursued a means of&nbsp;<br>investigation that&nbsp;was&nbsp;likely&nbsp;to confirm&nbsp;or dispel their&nbsp;<br>suspicions&nbsp;quickly.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>United States v. Sharpe</i>, 470 U.S. 675,&nbsp;<br>686 (1985). &nbsp;Vinton contends that “[a]fter the frisk was&nbsp;<br>complete, the officers&nbsp;continued&nbsp;to detain&nbsp;Vinton for&nbsp;<br>approximately 45 minutes, including 30 minutes until&nbsp;<br>Investigator Hodge arrived on the scene and an additional 15&nbsp;<br>minutes while the[y] obtained advice from&nbsp;supervisors . . . .”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Appellant’s Br. 38–39. &nbsp;However, Vinton waived this&nbsp;<br>argument by failing&nbsp;to raise&nbsp;it before the district court. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;<br>Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(e) (any defense or objection not raised in&nbsp;<br>a motion to suppress is waived);&nbsp;<i>United States v. Redman</i>,&nbsp;<br>331 F.3d 982, 986 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (holding appellant waived&nbsp;<br>argument by failing to assert it at&nbsp;suppression hearing). &nbsp;In&nbsp;<br>any event, within the first few minutes of&nbsp;the traffic stop—as&nbsp;<br>soon as he found the butterfly&nbsp;knife—Officer Alton had&nbsp;<br>probable cause to arrest Vinton.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Alton acted promptly&nbsp;<br>and diligently to confirm&nbsp;his initial suspicions. &nbsp;His&nbsp;<br>subsequent efforts to determine precisely how to proceed&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

were a conscientious vindication of Vinton’s rights, not a&nbsp;<br>violation of them.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
C&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
Until recently, it was widely understood that&nbsp;<i>New York v.&nbsp;</i><br>
<i>Belton</i>, 453 U.S. 454, 460 (1981), established a “bright-line&nbsp;<br>rule,” whereby “incident to arrest the police may search the&nbsp;<br>passenger compartment of an arrestee’s automobile.” &nbsp;<i>United&nbsp;<br>States v. Wesley</i>, 293 F.3d 541, 548 (D.C. Cir. 2002);&nbsp;<i>see also</i>&nbsp;<br><i>United States v. Mapp</i>, 476 F.3d 1012, 1018 (D.C. Cir. 2007)&nbsp;<br>(“As long as the arrest of an&nbsp;occupant of a car is lawful, a&nbsp;<br>search&nbsp;of the passenger compartment is&nbsp;reasonable.”). &nbsp;But&nbsp;<br>while the instant appeal was pending, the Supreme Court&nbsp;<br>decided&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Arizona v. Gant</i>, which reshaped the law governing&nbsp;<br>searches incident to arrest in&nbsp;the automobile context. &nbsp;129 S.&nbsp;<br>Ct. at 1714. &nbsp;Noting that&nbsp;<i>Chimel v. California</i>, 395 U.S. 752,&nbsp;<br>763 (1969), had held that “a search incident to arrest may&nbsp;<br>only include the arrestee’s person&nbsp;and the area within his&nbsp;<br>immediate control,” the Court&nbsp;explained that a reading of&nbsp;<br><i>Belton</i>&nbsp;that would&nbsp;<i>always&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>authorize a vehicle search incident&nbsp;<br>to an occupant’s arrest “would&nbsp;. . . untether the rule from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>justifications underlying the&nbsp;<i>Chimel</i>&nbsp;exception.” &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 1716,&nbsp;<br>1719 (internal quotation marks omitted). &nbsp;Thus,&nbsp;<i>Gant</i>&nbsp;held&nbsp;<br>police may search&nbsp;a vehicle incident to the arrest of an&nbsp;<br>occupant only in two circumstances: (1) “when the arrestee is&nbsp;<br>unsecured&nbsp;and within&nbsp;reaching&nbsp;distance of the passenger&nbsp;<br>compartment at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the&nbsp;search” (the safety rationale);&nbsp;<br>or (2) “when it is ‘reasonable to believe evidence relevant to&nbsp;<br>the crime of arrest might be&nbsp;found in the vehicle’” (the&nbsp;<br>evidentiary rationale). &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 1719 (footnote omitted) (quoting&nbsp;<br><i>Thornton v. United States</i>, 541 U.S. 615, 632 (2004) (Scalia,&nbsp;<br>J., concurring in judgment)).3&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>3&nbsp;Vinton argues that&nbsp;<i>Gant</i>&nbsp;also applies to&nbsp;<i>Terry&nbsp;</i>searches. &nbsp;Thus, he&nbsp;<br>contends Officer Alton’s initial protective search of&nbsp;his car was&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
During the protective search&nbsp;of Vinton’s car, Officer&nbsp;<br>
Alton found a locked briefcase on the backseat. &nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;<br></i>Suppression Tr. at 24, 26, 74. &nbsp;After placing Vinton under&nbsp;<br>arrest, Alton pried it open. &nbsp;<i>See id.</i>&nbsp;at 29, 74–75. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<br>government concedes that this&nbsp;search incident to Vinton’s&nbsp;<br>arrest cannot be upheld under&nbsp;<i>Gant</i>’s&nbsp;safety rationale because&nbsp;<br>Vinton was handcuffed at the time. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Appellee’s Br. 39.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Nonetheless, the government argues the search should be&nbsp;<br>upheld under&nbsp;<i>Gant</i>’s evidentiary rationale.4&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme&nbsp;Court did not elaborate on the&nbsp;<br>circumstances when it will be “reasonable to believe evidence&nbsp;<br>relevant to the crime of arrest&nbsp;might be found in the vehicle.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>Gant</i>, 129 S. Ct. at 1719 (internal quotation marks omitted);&nbsp;<br><i>see also id.</i>&nbsp;(noting that&nbsp;this evidentiary rationale “does not&nbsp;<br>follow from&nbsp;<i>Chimel</i>” but is based on “circumstances unique&nbsp;<br>to the vehicle context”). &nbsp;Presumably, the “reasonable to&nbsp;<br>believe” standard requires less than&nbsp;probable cause, because&nbsp;<br>otherwise&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gant</i>’s evidentiary rationale would merely&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>unconstitutional because&nbsp;he was handcuffed at the time of the&nbsp;<br>search. &nbsp;We&nbsp;decline to read&nbsp;<i>Gant</i>&nbsp;so expansively.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme&nbsp;<br>Court explicitly&nbsp;limited its holding&nbsp;to the search-incident-to-arrest&nbsp;<br>context,&nbsp;<i>see Gant</i>, 129 S.&nbsp;Ct. at 1723–24, and it is doubtful that the&nbsp;<br>same rule ought to apply&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Terry</i>&nbsp;search context,&nbsp;<i>see id.</i>&nbsp;at 1724&nbsp;<br>(Scalia, J., concurring)&nbsp;(“It must be borne in&nbsp;mind&nbsp;that we are&nbsp;<br>speaking here only&nbsp;of a rule&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;permitting&nbsp;a search when&nbsp;<br>the driver or an occupant is arrested. . .&nbsp;. &nbsp;In the no-arrest case, the&nbsp;<br>possibility&nbsp;of&nbsp;access to weapons in&nbsp;the vehicle always&nbsp;exists, since&nbsp;<br>the driver or passenger&nbsp;will be allowed to return&nbsp;to the vehicle&nbsp;<br>when the interrogation is completed.”).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>4&nbsp;The government also argues Vinton had no reasonable expectation&nbsp;<br>of privacy&nbsp;in&nbsp;the briefcase, and consequently&nbsp;no protected Fourth&nbsp;<br>Amendment interest in it, because he disclaimed ownership of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>We have no need to reach this issue.&nbsp;<br>

duplicate the “automobile exception,” which the Court&nbsp;<br>specifically identified as&nbsp;a distinct&nbsp;exception to the warrant&nbsp;<br>requirement. &nbsp;<i>See id.</i>&nbsp;at 1721 (citing&nbsp;<i>United States v. Ross</i>,&nbsp;<br>456 U.S. 798, 820–21 (1982)). &nbsp;Rather, the “reasonable to&nbsp;<br>believe” standard probably is akin to the&nbsp;“reasonable&nbsp;<br>suspicion”&nbsp;standard required to justify a&nbsp;<i>Terry</i>&nbsp;search. &nbsp;<i>See,&nbsp;<br>e.g.</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Adams</i>, 407 U.S. at&nbsp;146 (noting that a&nbsp;<i>Terry</i>&nbsp;search is&nbsp;<br>permissible if the officer “has&nbsp;<i>reason to believe</i>&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>suspect is armed and dangerous” (emphasis added)).&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Accordingly, the officer’s assessment of the likelihood that&nbsp;<br>there&nbsp;will be&nbsp;relevant evidence&nbsp;inside the car must be based&nbsp;<br>on more than “a mere hunch,” but&nbsp;“falls considerably short of&nbsp;<br>[needing to] satisfy[] a preponderance of the evidence&nbsp;<br>standard.” &nbsp;<i>Arvizu</i>, 534 U.S. at 274.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Supreme Court explained&nbsp;that&nbsp;“[i]n many cases, as&nbsp;<br>
when a recent occupant is arrested for a traffic violation, there&nbsp;<br>will be&nbsp;no reasonable basis to&nbsp;believe the vehicle&nbsp;contains&nbsp;<br>relevant evidence. &nbsp;But in others, including&nbsp;<i>Belton</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br><i>Thornton</i>, the offense of&nbsp;arrest&nbsp;will supply&nbsp;a basis for&nbsp;<br>searching the passenger compartment of an arrestee’s&nbsp;vehicle&nbsp;<br>and any containers therein.” &nbsp;<i>Gant</i>, 129 S. Ct. at 1719&nbsp;<br>(citation omitted). &nbsp;In both&nbsp;<i>Belton</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Thornton</i>, the vehicle&nbsp;<br>occupants were arrested for possession of narcotics. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;<br><i>Belton</i>, 453 U.S. at 456;&nbsp;<i>Thornton</i>, 541 U.S. at 618. &nbsp;Had&nbsp;<br>Vinton been arrested merely&nbsp;for speeding or driving with&nbsp;<br>excessively tinted windows,&nbsp;<i>Gant</i>’s evidentiary rationale&nbsp;<br>obviously would not have authorized a subsequent search&nbsp;<br>because under the circumstances it would have been&nbsp;very&nbsp;<br>unlikely that evidence&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;to either&nbsp;of&nbsp;those traffic&nbsp;<br>offenses would be found inside his car. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;<i>Gant</i>, 129 S. Ct.&nbsp;<br>at 1719 (holding that “[a]n evidentiary basis for the search&nbsp;<br>was . . . lacking . . . [because] Gant was arrested for driving&nbsp;<br>with a suspended license—an offense for which police could&nbsp;<br>not expect to find evidence in the passenger compartment of&nbsp;<br>

[his] car”). &nbsp;But instead, Vinton&nbsp;was arrested for the unlawful&nbsp;<br>possession of a weapon, an offense that resembles narcotics-<br>possession offenses far more&nbsp;closely than it resembles&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>traffic violation. &nbsp;Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a principled&nbsp;<br>basis for distinguishing the possession of narcotics from the&nbsp;<br>possession of an unlawful weapon, where an arrest for the&nbsp;<br>former makes it reasonable to&nbsp;believe additional narcotics&nbsp;<br>remain in the car, but an arrest for the latter does&nbsp;not make it&nbsp;<br>reasonable to believe&nbsp;additional&nbsp;weapons are in the car. &nbsp;In&nbsp;<br>both cases, the defendant has been caught with a type of&nbsp;<br>contraband sufficiently small to be&nbsp;hidden throughout a car&nbsp;<br>and frequently possessed in multiple quantities.&nbsp; Indeed, this&nbsp;<br>fact was well-known to Officer&nbsp;Alton, who testified that&nbsp;<br>“generally&nbsp;if one weapon&nbsp;is there . .&nbsp;. there’s the chance that&nbsp;<br>other weapons could be there.” &nbsp;Suppression Tr. 14;&nbsp;<i>see id.</i>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<br>28.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
The facts of this case establish that Alton was reasonable&nbsp;<br>
in expecting there might be&nbsp;additional weapons in the car,&nbsp;<br>particularly in the locked briefcase found on the backseat.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Most significantly, Officer&nbsp;Alton already had found&nbsp;<i>two</i>&nbsp;<br>knives, one of which was hidden. &nbsp;He also had found two cans&nbsp;<br>of mace and&nbsp;a bag&nbsp;of earplugs. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;<i>id.</i>&nbsp;at 23, 26, 73–74. &nbsp;Of&nbsp;<br>course, earplugs often are used&nbsp;for purposes unrelated to&nbsp;<br>weapons, but, as Alton reasonably recognized, they also are&nbsp;<br>commonly used at firing ranges to muffle the noise from&nbsp;<br>guns. &nbsp;<i>See id.</i>&nbsp;at 26, 74. &nbsp;Thus, having found two objects,&nbsp;<br>mace and earplugs, that suggested at least a possible&nbsp;<br>association with weapons, along with two other objects, a&nbsp;<br>sheathed knife and a butterfly knife, that were clearly capable&nbsp;<br>of being used as weapons, Officer Alton had an objectively&nbsp;<br>reasonable basis for believing&nbsp;that additional weapons might&nbsp;<br>be inside&nbsp;the car. &nbsp;A material element of the CDW&nbsp;offense is&nbsp;<br>that the defendant intends to&nbsp;use the object as&nbsp;a dangerous&nbsp;<br>weapon. &nbsp;<i>See Lewis</i>, 767 A.2d at 222. &nbsp;Finding additional&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<A name=18></a>18&nbsp;<br>
weapons in Vinton’s possession&nbsp;would have provided strong&nbsp;<br>circumstantial evidence of this specific intent. &nbsp;Thus, because&nbsp;<br>it was&nbsp;“reasonable to believe&nbsp;evidence relevant&nbsp;to the crime of&nbsp;<br>arrest might be found in&nbsp;the vehicle,” Officer Alton had the&nbsp;<br>right to search the passenger compartment of Vinton’s car&nbsp;<br>“and any&nbsp;containers therein,” including the locked briefcase.5&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>Gant</i>, 129 S. Ct. at 1719 (internal quotation marks omitted).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The district&nbsp;court therefore properly admitted into evidence&nbsp;<br>the ecstasy,&nbsp;semiautomatic&nbsp;pistol, pistol magazines, and&nbsp;<br>“fighting knife” discovered&nbsp;inside the briefcase.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

Vinton also&nbsp;argues his&nbsp;statements were admitted into&nbsp;<br>
evidence in&nbsp;violation of his rights under&nbsp;<i>Miranda v. Arizona</i>,&nbsp;<br>384 U.S. 436 (1966). &nbsp;<i>Miranda</i>&nbsp;warnings are required “where&nbsp;<br>a suspect in custody is subjected to interrogation.” &nbsp;<i>Rhode&nbsp;<br>Island v. Innis</i>, 446 U.S. 291, 300 (1980). &nbsp;Because “ordinary&nbsp;<br>traffic stops” are “noncoercive,” “persons&nbsp;temporarily&nbsp;<br>detained pursuant to such stops are not ‘in custody’ for the&nbsp;<br>purposes of Miranda.” &nbsp;<i>Berkemer v.&nbsp;McCarty</i>, 468 U.S. 420,&nbsp;<br>440 (1984). &nbsp;However, “[i]f a motorist who has been detained&nbsp;<br>pursuant to&nbsp;a traffic stop&nbsp;thereafter&nbsp;is subjected&nbsp;to treatment&nbsp;<br>that renders him&nbsp;‘in custody’ for&nbsp;practical purposes, he will be&nbsp;<br>entitled to the full panoply of&nbsp;protections prescribed by&nbsp;<br>Miranda.” &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
Most of the statements Vinton claims&nbsp;were improperly&nbsp;<br>
admitted were made by him&nbsp;while he was sitting in his car,&nbsp;<br>before Officer Alton handcuffed&nbsp;him and searched his car.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>This includes his statements that he worked in personal&nbsp;<br>security, used the sheathed knife only for fishing with his&nbsp;<br>grandfather, had no other weapons in the car, and “keeps that&nbsp;<br>part of his trade at home.” &nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;</i>Suppression Tr. at 11–12, 14,&nbsp;<br>71. &nbsp;At the time&nbsp;he made&nbsp;these statements, Vinton was not “in&nbsp;<br>custody” and faced an “ordinary,” “noncoercive” traffic stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>See Berkemer</i>, 468 U.S.&nbsp;at 440. &nbsp;Thus, he had no entitlement&nbsp;<br>to&nbsp;<i>Miranda</i>&nbsp;warnings.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
Vinton also challenges the&nbsp;admission of two statements&nbsp;<br>
he made after being handcuffed for some&nbsp;time but before&nbsp;<br>being formally arrested: that he used the earplugs as sleeping&nbsp;<br>aids, and that he did not own&nbsp;the locked briefcase or&nbsp;know&nbsp;<br>what was inside of&nbsp;it. &nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Suppression Tr. at 26, 74. &nbsp;We&nbsp;<br>need not decide whether Vinton&nbsp;was “in custody” at the time&nbsp;<br>he made these statements, because&nbsp;any&nbsp;<i>Miranda</i>&nbsp;violation was&nbsp;<br>harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. &nbsp;Both of these&nbsp;<br>statements were wholly exculpatory and&nbsp;could not have&nbsp;<br>“contribute[d] to the verdict obtained.” &nbsp;<i>United States v.&nbsp;<br>Harris</i>, 515 F.3d 1307, 1311 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (internal&nbsp;<br>quotation marks omitted). &nbsp;Thus, even assuming a&nbsp;<i>Miranda</i>&nbsp;<br>violation occurred, there is&nbsp;no basis for reversal.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
IV&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the&nbsp;district&nbsp;<br>
court is&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<i>Affirmed</i>.&nbsp;<br>
