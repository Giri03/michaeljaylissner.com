<b>OPINION</b><br>
NIEMEYER, Circuit Judge:<br>
Prior to closing on a loan to refinance their principal resi-<br>
dence, Rita and Barry Weintraub attempted to exercise the<br>right to rescind given by the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.<br>§&nbsp;1635(a), and demanded a refund of their $500 deposit. The<br>lender, Quicken Loans, Inc., refunded the balance of the<br>deposit after deducting the costs of a credit report and an<br>appraisal but refused to refund the entire $500.<br>
The Weintraubs commenced this action, seeking a declara-<br>
tory judgment that Quicken Loans violated the Truth in Lend-<br>ing Act, injunctive relief, compensatory and statutory<br>damages, and attorneys’ fees. On Quicken Loans’ motion, the<br>district court granted it summary judgment, holding that the<br>right to rescind given by §&nbsp;1635(a) is available only to rescind<br>a consummated credit transaction. The court concluded that<br>because the Weintraubs elected not to go through with the<br>loan before closing, they were not entitled to any relief under<br>the Truth in Lending Act.<br>
We agree and affirm.<br>
I<br>
On February 1, 2008, Rita and Barry Weintraub applied by<br>
telephone to Quicken Loans for a $220,000 loan, payable over<br>30 years at a fixed rate of interest, to refinance their principal<br>residence, a townhouse in Stafford County, Virginia. On the<br>same day, Quicken Loans electronically transmitted to the<br>Weintraubs two documents: (1) A &quot;Good Faith Estimate,&quot;<br>based on an estimated interest rate of 5.75% and the Wein-<br>traubs’ estimated house value of $340,000; and (2) an &quot;Inter-<br>est Rate Disclosure-(Not Locked) and Deposit Agreement.&quot;<br>The Interest Rate Disclosure portion of this document pro-<br>vided:<br>
<hr>

3<br>
You have chosen&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;to &quot;lock&quot; the interest rate on<br>the above loan program. This means that your inter-<br>est rate is not guaranteed for any period of time and<br>is subject to change without advance notice.<br>
This document also included a Deposit Agreement requiring<br>the Weintraubs, as part of their application, to pay Quicken<br>Loans a $500 deposit for out-of-pocket expenses. The Deposit<br>Agreement provided:<br>
If your application is approved: At the closing,<br>Lender will credit the amount of your deposit on<br>your closing statement toward your closing costs. If<br>your application is denied: Lender will refund the<br>deposit less the actual amount of out-of-pocket costs<br>incurred on your behalf for, among other items, the<br>cost of an appraisal and/or credit report. A condi-<br>tional approval or request for additional information<br>is not a denial. The deposit will&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;be refunded if<br>you don’t fully cooperate in or complete the applica-<br>tion process (including submitting all required docu-<br>mentation in a timely manner), choose to withdraw<br>your application, or choose not to close the transac-<br>tion for any reason (including changing interest<br>rates).<br>
Three days later, on February 4, 2008, Barry Weintraub<br>
electronically signed the two documents. He also paid the<br>$500 deposit by credit card.<br>
Quicken Loans conditionally approved the loan that the<br>
Weintraubs requested. Among the conditions was Quicken<br>Loans’ receipt of a &quot;satisfactory home appraisal.&quot;<br>
An independent appraiser conducted an appraisal of the<br>
Weintraubs’ home on February 7, 2008, and estimated its<br>value to be $308,000. This amount was $32,000 below the<br>$340,000 estimate that the Weintraubs had provided to<br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a>4<br>
WEINTRAUB&nbsp;v. QUICKEN&nbsp;LOANS<br>
Quicken Loans for use in its Good Faith Estimate. Because<br>this lower-than-anticipated appraisal meant that the $220,000<br>loan amount was greater than 70% of the townhouse’s esti-<br>mated value, Quicken Loans added a half-point discount fee<br>to the closing costs for the loan. On February 18, Quicken<br>Loans provided the Weintraubs with the closing documents,<br>which reflected the half-point adjustment and which included<br>a &quot;Federal Truth-In-Lending Statement&quot; and &quot;Notices of<br>Right to Cancel,&quot; and it scheduled closing for February 26.<br>The Notices of Right to Cancel provided:<br>
You are entering into a transaction that will result in<br>a mortgage/lien/security interest on/in your home.<br>You have a legal right under federal law to cancel<br>this transaction, without cost, within THREE BUSI-<br>NESS DAYS from whichever of the following<br>events occurs last:<br>
(1) The date of the transaction, which is<br>February 26, 2008; or<br>
(2) The date you received your Truth in<br>Lending disclosures; or<br>
(3) The date you received this notice of<br>your right to cancel.<br>
If you cancel the transaction, the mort-<br>gage/lien/security interest is also cancelled. Within<br>20 CALENDAR DAYS after we receive your notice,<br>we must take the steps necessary to reflect the fact<br>that the mortgage/lien/security interest on/in your<br>home has been cancelled, and we must return to you<br>any money or property you have given to us or to<br>anyone else in connection with this transaction.<br>
Because Quicken Loans added the half-point discount fee<br>
to the closing costs, the Weintraubs decided not to go through<br>
<hr>
<A name=5></a>WEINTRAUB&nbsp;v. QUICKEN&nbsp;LOANS<br>
5<br>
with the loan, and on February 20 they advised Quicken<br>Loans of their decision by sending it executed Notices of<br>Right to Cancel and a cover letter requesting a return of the<br>$500 deposit.<br>
Quicken Loans refused to return the full $500 deposit,<br>
referring to the Deposit Agreement, which provided that<br>&quot;[t]he deposit will&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;be refunded if you . . . choose to with-<br>draw your application, or choose not to close the transaction<br>for any reason (including changing interest rates).&quot; Despite<br>this contractual language, Quicken Loans refunded $129.41 to<br>the Weintraubs, after deducting $350 for the cost of the<br>appraisal and $20.59 for the cost of obtaining a credit report.<br>
The Weintraubs commenced this action against Quicken<br>
Loans, alleging that Quicken Loans’ failure to provide them<br>with a full refund of their deposit within 20 days of receiving<br>an executed notice to cancel violated §&nbsp;1635(b) of the Truth<br>in Lending Act (&quot;TILA&quot;), 15 U.S.C. §&nbsp;1601&nbsp;<i>et seq</i>. On<br>Quicken Loans’ motion, the district court granted it summary<br>judgment, holding that because the Weintraubs withdrew their<br>loan application prior to closing, the loan between the Wein-<br>traubs and Quicken Loans was never consummated and there<br>was no &quot;consumer credit transaction&quot; that could give rise to<br>the right to rescind. From the district court’s judgment, the<br>Weintraubs filed this appeal, presenting the single question of<br>whether the Weintraubs could rescind a loan transaction<br>before its closing and receive back their entire application<br>deposit.<br>
II<br>
The right to rescind, on which the Weintraubs rely, is con-<br>
tained in §&nbsp;1635(a) of TILA, which provides:<br>
<i>[I]n the case of any consumer credit transaction</i>&nbsp;. . .<br>in which a security interest . . . is or will be retained<br>or acquired in any property which is used as the prin-<br>
<hr>
<A name=6></a>6<br>
WEINTRAUB&nbsp;v. QUICKEN&nbsp;LOANS<br>
cipal dwelling of the person to whom credit is<br>extended,&nbsp;<i>the obligor shall have the right to rescind<br>the transaction</i>&nbsp;until midnight of the third business<br>day following the consummation of the transaction<br>or the delivery of the information and rescission<br>forms required under this section together with a<br>statement containing the material disclosures<br>required under this subchapter, whichever is later,&nbsp;<i>by<br>notifying the creditor</i>, in accordance with regulations<br>of the Board, of his intention to do so.<br>
15 U.S.C. §&nbsp;1635(a) (emphasis added). If the lender does not<br>deliver the disclosures to the debtor, this &quot;right of rescission&quot;<br>expires three years &quot;after the date of the consummation of the<br>transaction or upon the sale of the property, whichever occurs<br>first.&quot;&nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§&nbsp;1635(f). Once the right to rescind is properly exer-<br>cised, the creditor must return to the debtor &quot;any money or<br>property given as earnest money, downpayment, or other-<br>wise&quot; within 20 days.&nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§&nbsp;1635(b).<br>
Because the right to rescind only applies &quot;[i]n the case of<br>
any consumer credit transaction,&quot; the issue in this case is<br>whether there can be a &quot;consumer credit transaction&quot; giving<br>rise to the right to rescind before the transaction is consum-<br>mated or closed.<br>
In concluding that no &quot;consumer credit transaction&quot;<br>
occurred in this case to trigger TILA’s right to rescind, the<br>district court noted that even though TILA does not define the<br>term &quot;transaction,&quot; it does define the terms &quot;residential mort-<br>gage transaction&quot; and &quot;reverse mortgage transaction,&quot; which<br>treat &quot;transaction&quot; as a consummated event. Focusing on the<br>effect of a &quot;rescission&quot; on the legal obligations of the parties,<br>the court concluded that only a completed credit transaction<br>could be eligible for rescission.&nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;15 U.S.C. §&nbsp;1635(b). In<br>addition, the court relied on our cases, which hold in the con-<br>text of an automobile loan that liability for improper disclo-<br>sures under §&nbsp;1638 of TILA does not attach until after<br>

consummation of a consumer credit transaction.&nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;Nigh v.<br>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.</i>, 319 F.3d 119, 123 (4th Cir.<br>2003),&nbsp;<i>rev’d on other grounds</i>, 543 U.S. 50 (2004);&nbsp;<i>Baxter v.<br>Sparks Oldsmobile, Inc.</i>, 579 F.2d 863, 864 (4th Cir. 1978).<br>Finally, the court referred to the applicable provision of the<br>Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R.<br>§&nbsp;226.23(a)(3), as well as the Official Staff Interpretations, 12<br>C.F.R. Pt. 226, Supp. I, and Rescission Model Form (Gen-<br>eral), 12 C.F.R. Pt. 226, App. H-8, to conclude that all three<br>conditions listed in §&nbsp;1635(a)—(1) consummation of the<br>transaction, (2) delivery of &quot;Notices of Right to Cancel,&quot; and<br>(3) delivery of TILA disclosures—had to be satisfied before<br>any right to rescind could arise. Thus, because the Weintraubs<br>never consummated their loan, they did not have the right to<br>rescind it under §&nbsp;1635(a).<br>
On appeal, Quicken Loans reiterates the district court’s rea-<br>
soning, urging us to affirm.<br>
The Weintraubs assert, however, that the text of §&nbsp;1635(a)<br>
does not require that a loan be consummated before the right<br>to rescind can arise. Moreover, they argue, because TILA is<br>a remedial statute, it should be construed liberally in the con-<br>sumer’s favor. Quoting&nbsp;<i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, they employ<br>from the definition of &quot;transaction&quot; the broadest meaning to<br>argue that it is &quot;[a]ny activity involving two or more per-<br>sons.&quot;*&nbsp;Accordingly, they reason that even without consum-<br>mation, a &quot;consumer credit transaction&quot; can exist and can be<br>&quot;rescinded&quot; anytime after two or more parties begin negotia-<br>tions for a potential extension of credit. While they acknowl-<br>edge that &quot;transaction&quot; includes a consummated agreement,<br>they note that it can &quot;just as easily refer to the process o[f]<br>
*The full definition of &quot;transaction&quot; given is as follows: &quot;1. The act or<br>
an instance of conducting business or other dealings; esp., the formation,<br>performance, or discharge of a contract. 2. Something performed or car-<br>ried out; a business agreement or exchange. 3. Any activity involving two<br>or more persons. . . .&quot;&nbsp;<i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>&nbsp;1635 (9th ed. 2009).&nbsp;<br>

doing some business without regard to whether a final agree-<br>ment or specific result is produced.&quot; With this reasoning, they<br>conclude that a &quot;consumer credit transaction&quot; occurred in this<br>case and that therefore the right to rescind the transaction, as<br>provided in §&nbsp;1635(a), arose. Addressing the district court’s<br>reliance on the decisions in&nbsp;<i>Baxter</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Nigh</i>, the Weintraubs<br>maintain that these cases do not apply to the right to rescind<br>created by §&nbsp;1635(a) as they dealt with liability for improper<br>disclosures under §&nbsp;1638 in the context of automobile financ-<br>ing.<br>
The Weintraubs argue further that interpreting §&nbsp;1635(a) to<br>
require consummation of a transaction before the right to<br>rescind can arise would lead to perverse incentives and absurd<br>results. Specifically, they observe that requiring consumma-<br>tion would encourage debtors to follow through wastefully to<br>the closing of a transaction, even though they had earlier<br>determined to cancel, simply to be able to get their deposits<br>back. Also, lenders, recognizing that all three conditions of a<br>§&nbsp;1635(a) rescission must be satisfied before the right to<br>rescind can arise, would be inclined to withhold disclosures<br>so as not to trigger this right. Indeed, they suggest, requiring<br>that all three conditions be satisfied before the right to rescind<br>arises would render 15 U.S.C. §&nbsp;1635(f), which limits the time<br>period within which a consumer can exercise the right to<br>rescind to three years after consummation if the lender fails<br>to provide disclosures, a &quot;meaningless nullity.&quot; Because of<br>these perverse consequences, the Weintraubs contend that the<br>right to rescind must arise as soon as&nbsp;<i>any one</i>&nbsp;of the three con-<br>ditions is satisfied. Because they received the Notices of Right<br>to Cancel and the TILA disclosures before they attempted to<br>exercise the right to rescind, two of the three conditions were<br>satisfied, and they therefore had the right to rescind.<br>
We begin by addressing the applicability of&nbsp;<i>Baxter</i>&nbsp;and<br>
<i>Nigh</i>&nbsp;to this case. To be sure, those decisions arose in a differ-<br>ent context in which we were faced with the question whether<br>liability&nbsp;<i>under §&nbsp;1638</i>&nbsp;of TILA attaches prior to consumma-<br>
<hr>

tion of a consumer credit transaction for the purchase of an<br>automobile. In&nbsp;<i>Baxter</i>, we began by noting that &quot;[w]hen a<br>retailer arranges credit for his purchaser through a third party,<br>the transaction of sale becomes a ‘credit transaction’ . . . sub-<br>ject to the terms of the Truth in Lending Act.&quot; 579 F.2d at<br>864. We rejected, however, the consumer’s claim for damages<br>based on the lender’s violation of the disclosure provisions of<br>TILA because the consumer cancelled the transaction before<br>it was consummated. Under these circumstances, there was no<br>&quot;credit transaction&quot; to which TILA would apply. Accordingly,<br>we held that although the lender &quot;was obligated to make the<br>proper disclosures prior to the extension of credit, . . . the<br>Truth in Lending Act does not impose penalty until credit is<br>in fact extended.&quot;&nbsp;<i>Id.</i><br>
In&nbsp;<i>Nigh</i>, we both followed and distinguished&nbsp;<i>Baxter</i>. The<br>
consumer there had become obligated to complete the transac-<br>tion by signing the contract documents and delivering them,<br>but because the lender encountered problems finding financ-<br>ing for the transaction, it never countersigned them.&nbsp;<i>Nigh</i>, 319<br>F.3d at 122. In determining whether the consumer could<br>obtain damages for false statements made during the course<br>of negotiations, we noted that &quot;TILA liability . . . cannot<br>accrue&nbsp;<i>until</i>&nbsp;a credit transaction is consummated, or put<br>another way, ‘until credit is in fact extended,’ since until<br>credit is extended to a person in a particular transaction there<br>are no credit terms against which to assess a disclosure’s<br>accuracy.&quot;&nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 123 (quoting&nbsp;<i>Baxter</i>, 579 F.3d at 864). But<br>because the consumer there had become&nbsp;<i>contractually obli-<br>gated</i>&nbsp;on the credit transaction, we held that&nbsp;<i>Baxter</i>&nbsp;was satis-<br>fied, even though the transaction had not been formally<br>consummated.&nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 124.<br>
Although&nbsp;<i>Baxter</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Nigh</i>&nbsp;both dealt with TILA liability<br>
under §&nbsp;1638 for improper disclosures in connection with<br>consumer credit transactions relating to the purchase of an<br>automobile, we believe that the principle that a credit transac-<br>tion must be consummated to trigger TILA liability applies<br>
<hr>
<A name=10></a>10<br>
WEINTRAUB&nbsp;v. QUICKEN&nbsp;LOANS<br>
with equal force to the right to rescind created by §&nbsp;1635(a).<br>Rather than dealing exclusively with some aspect of TILA<br>unique to §&nbsp;1638 or to the automobile context, these cases<br>stand for the broader principle that only when a loan has been<br>consummated does a &quot;credit transaction&quot; exist that gives rise<br>to liability under TILA. Because &quot;credit transaction&quot; is a term<br>used in both §&nbsp;1635 and §&nbsp;1638, indeed throughout TILA, we<br>think that&nbsp;<i>Baxter</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Nigh</i>&nbsp;are relevant to understanding what<br>constitutes a &quot;transaction&quot; that may, under §&nbsp;1635(a) of TILA,<br>be rescinded. Thus, we conclude, no &quot;consumer credit trans-<br>action&quot; exists for which the right to rescind can be exercised<br>until that transaction has been consummated, &quot;or put another<br>way, ‘until credit is in fact extended.’&quot;&nbsp;<i>Nigh</i>, 319 F.3d at 123<br>(quoting&nbsp;<i>Baxter</i>, 579 F.2d at 864).<br>
Apart from&nbsp;<i>Baxter</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Nigh</i>, the language and operation of<br>
§&nbsp;1635(a) supports our conclusion that the right to rescind<br>under §&nbsp;1635(a) can only arise when a transaction has been<br>consummated. Section 1635(a) creates a right &quot;to rescind the<br><i>transaction</i>.&quot; (Emphasis added). The term &quot;transaction,&quot; while<br>not separately defined, is included as part of two other defined<br>terms, each of which presupposes that the &quot;transaction&quot; must<br>be consummated. A &quot;residential mortgage&nbsp;<i>transaction</i>,&quot;<br>defined in §&nbsp;1602, is &quot;a transaction in which a mortgage, deed<br>of trust, purchase money security interest arising under an<br>installment sales contract, or equivalent consensual security<br>interest&nbsp;<i>is created or retained</i>&nbsp;against the consumer’s dwelling<br>to finance the acquisition or initial construction of such dwell-<br>ing.&quot; 15 U.S.C. §&nbsp;1602(w) (emphasis added). Similarly, a &quot;re-<br>verse mortgage&nbsp;<i>transaction</i>,&quot; also defined in §&nbsp;1602, is &quot;a<br>nonrecourse transaction in which a mortgage, deed of trust, or<br>equivalent consensual security interest&nbsp;<i>is created</i>&nbsp;against the<br>consumer’s principle dwelling . . . .&quot;&nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§&nbsp;1602(bb) (emphasis<br>added). Both definitions treat &quot;transaction&quot; as a consummated<br>event, indicating that any credit transaction under §&nbsp;1635(a)<br>must be consummated for the right to rescind to attach.<br>
Moreover, while the Weintraubs have relied on the broad<br>
definition of &quot;transaction&quot; taken from&nbsp;<i>Black’s Law Dictio-</i><br>
<hr>
<A name=11></a>WEINTRAUB&nbsp;v. QUICKEN&nbsp;LOANS<br>
11<br>
<i>nary</i>, they have failed to account for the alternative definition<br>geared more toward business contexts.&nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;Black’s Law Dic-<br>tionary</i>, 1635 (9th ed. 2009) (defining &quot;transaction&quot; in the<br>business context as &quot;[s]omething performed or carried out; a<br>business agreement or exchange&quot;). In a business context<br>where goods, services, or funds are to be exchanged, one<br>would hardly conclude that he had entered into a transaction<br>without actually performing the exchange.<br>
Similarly, a commonsense reading of the text of §&nbsp;1635(a)<br>
also suggests that &quot;transaction&quot; refers to a consummated,<br>binding agreement, rather than to the whole course of the par-<br>ties’ interactions. The right to rescind a transaction defined as<br>the whole course of interactions between the parties would<br>essentially be meaningless—there would often be nothing to<br>rescind. Surely, what Congress intended instead was to give<br>debtors a limited right to back out of binding loan obligations<br>about which they were having second thoughts. But until a<br>loan is consummated, the consumer has incurred no obliga-<br>tion from which he would need a statutorily created right to<br>back out. Moreover, there is nothing to indicate that Congress<br>intended the Weintraubs’ construction, which would, in<br>effect, give potential borrowers a right to a &quot;free application&quot;<br>for home financing, requiring lenders to bear the costs of<br>credit reports and appraisals regardless of whether the bor-<br>rower intended to proceed to a closing of the transaction.<br>
Finally, our conclusion is consistent with the interpretation<br>
of TILA advanced by the Board of Governors of the Federal<br>Reserve System in Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Pt. 226, which is<br>entitled to deference.&nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;Household Credit Servs., Inc. v.<br>Pfenning</i>, 541 U.S. 232, 238-39 (2004). In addition to reiterat-<br>ing the statutory right of rescission, Regulation Z provides<br>that &quot;[w]hen a consumer rescinds&nbsp;<i>a transaction</i>,&quot; the<br>&quot;[e]ffect[&nbsp;] of rescission&quot; is to render void &quot;the security inter-<br>est&nbsp;<i>giving rise</i>&nbsp;to the right of rescission.&quot; 12 C.F.R.<br>§&nbsp;226.23(d) (emphasis added). The object of rescission is thus<br>presumed to be a&nbsp;<i>transaction creating a security interest</i>&nbsp;in<br>
<hr>
<A name=12></a>12<br>
WEINTRAUB&nbsp;v. QUICKEN&nbsp;LOANS<br>
the consumer’s property. Likewise, the discussion in the Offi-<br>cial Staff Interpretations of the relevant section of Regulation<br>Z also presumes a completed transaction when stating that<br>&quot;[i]n order for the right of rescission to apply, the security<br>interest&nbsp;<i>must be retained</i>&nbsp;as part of the credit transaction.&quot; 12<br>C.F.R. Pt. 226, Supp. I (interpreting 12 C.F.R. §&nbsp;226.23(a)(1))<br>(emphasis added). This language further suggests that the<br>right to rescind a transaction creating a security interest can<br>only arise from a consummated transaction, because only<br>upon consummation of the transaction is the security interest<br>retained.<br>
While the Deposit Agreement in this case, pursuant to<br>
which the Weintraubs paid Quicken Loans the $500 deposit,<br>was undoubtedly a &quot;transaction&quot; entered into before consum-<br>mation of the credit transaction, TILA would certainly not<br>apply to that transaction because it did not involve an exten-<br>sion of credit.&nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;Baxter</i>, 579 F.2d at 864. Moreover, because<br>the Weintraubs withdrew their application before the loan was<br>consummated, the right to rescind given by §&nbsp;1635(a) never<br>arose, and Quicken Loans was therefore not obligated by<br>§&nbsp;1635(b) to return the full value of the deposit when the<br>Weintraubs attempted to exercise the right.<br>
In sum, we follow the definition of &quot;credit transaction&quot;<br>
established in&nbsp;<i>Baxter</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Nigh</i>, and hold that a consumer can-<br>not exercise the right to rescind created by §&nbsp;1635(a) until<br>after consummation of a consumer credit transaction. Accord-<br>ingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.<br>
<i>AFFIRMED</i><br>
