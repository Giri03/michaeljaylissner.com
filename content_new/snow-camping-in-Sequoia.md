I went snow camping with some friends in Sequoia National Park last weekend, and had a blast as always. We built a quinzhee and went snow shoeing and cross country skiing. The pictures are online if you are interested in seeing them, and per my custom, I brought along a couple of iButtons so that we could record our temperature the entire time. 

I set them up to record the temperature every five minutes to an accuracy of 0.1 degree Celsius. I just got a chance to work with the data a bit and I threw together a quick chart. The data are attached, if anybody is interested, but the chart really tells the story better than the 2,400 data points do.
