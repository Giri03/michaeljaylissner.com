For a while, I've been reading that mashups between various website technologies would soon be really easy to work with and play with and such. I didn't believe it until I noticed my website today.

Today, I added the <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> feed you all should be seeing on the left that lists the last five tracks I listened to on my home computer. With it's addition, on my homepage I now have a post about the San Diego fires that includes a java-based Google Map, a picture gallery that uses code from <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/" target="_blank">menalto.com</a>, and a nifty widget that ties in with my home computer.

I think mashups, in my opinion, are officially a reality. Pretty cool.
