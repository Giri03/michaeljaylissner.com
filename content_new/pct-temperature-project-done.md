I'm happy to announce that the PCT data project is complete! 

Over the past several weeks/months, I have been slaving away over my computer writing this program. When used, it will generate a dynamic graphing area that will load up temperature data for one to six PCT hikers. 

All those that are interested in the most complicated programming assignment I have ever worked on are welcome to check it out at <a href="http://www.michaeljaylissner.com/pct-temperatures">michaeljaylissner.com/pct-temperatures</a>.

I am officially a free man once again! Thanks to all who made this possible with their encouragement and patience!
