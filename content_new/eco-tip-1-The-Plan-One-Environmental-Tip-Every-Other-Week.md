Many people have been saying to me, "Dude, what's with the green blog...why's it so...ummm...green?" Well, there's a reason for this my friends. The reason is that I had to choose a color, and I went with green to go with my profound love of our friend Gaea. 

Along those lines, in thinking about things to post that might be interesting, I came up with a theory that if I put my mind to it, (and you, the public chips in, hint, hint) I (we) can come up with an environmental tip that is worth posting every two weeks or so.

This might not work out, then again it might. We'll see, it all depends on whether I (we) can come up with things to write.

So, to kick it off, I shall follow on the wisdom of my elders, and post the thing that I have been told is the MOST important thing to do to cut down YOUR carbon footprint: Insulate your house. 

From what I understand, it's really just that simple. If you want to make the biggest dollar/CO<sub>2</sub> reduction possible, make your house a fortress of insulation. No drafts equals less heater and less air-conditioner. And, since in 2006 59% of non-petroleum U.S. energy came from coal&sup1;, this is a very real way to cut down your impact. 

My plan this winter is to cover the windows with Cyran wrap, and see if I can get it to tighten up by hitting it with a blow dryer.
