Title: Project Idea: "Programming library for curse words"

When programming, there are occasionally times when you need to detect or block curse words. At CourtListener, for example, we make URLs with ID numbers in them that are formed by converting an ID number to letters (so a &rarr; 1, b &rarr; 2, 27 &rarr; A, etc). Higher numbers create longer strings of letters, so over time, this creates curse words in the URL. Currently, the site is only has a few four letter strings, but I will rue the day when any of the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Seven_dirty_words" target="_blank">seven dirty words</a> is being shown to users on my site.

There are many lists of curse words on the web, but none that is maintained or curated. Having that alone would be a useful project. What would make it better would be libraries in popular programming languages that efficiently told you if a string contained a curse word. 

The next feature would be to add additional languages, and then to add words like pen1s, which aren't normally curse words, but are certainly words you'd want to eliminate.

It'd be a pretty simple project, so I may just go for it.

Only question is, what do I name it?
