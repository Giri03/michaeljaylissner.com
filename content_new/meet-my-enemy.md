I'd like everybody to meet my new enemy, and that of my girlfriend, who is now working against bottled water. Behold Fuji: traveler from distant seas, pillager of distant islands, waster of petroleum, and emptier of pockets.

So, not only is <a href="http://www.google.com/products?q=fiji+water&oe=utf-8&scoring=p" target="_blank">Fiji water expensive</a>, but it also COMES FROM FIJI!!!! Think about that for a moment. Fiji is an island in the middle of the Pacific. Behold the planet Earth, and the island of Fiji:

Somehow, the water must get from there to here (it's about 5,500 miles to the bay area). Luckily, the bottle is square so they can fit a lot of it on a ship, but it must be bottled for weeks and months before it arrives here. Why are we pillaging this island? It's madness.<!--break-->
