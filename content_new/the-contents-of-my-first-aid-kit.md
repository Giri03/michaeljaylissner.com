I present to you approximately a decade's worth of first aid kit refinement. Emphasis is on completeness and lightness. Inside a custom silnylon envelope (with no zippers or fasteners that might slow down frostbitten, missing or otherwise failing hands), I have the following:<ul><li>An ultra-fine tipped 0.5ml syringe</li><li>A 1ml glass vial of epinephren</li><li>One half sheet moleskin and a small quantity of mole foam</li><li>Ten butterfly adhesive bandages</li><li>One package steri-strips</li><li>Two 2" x 3" non-adhesive pads</li><li>Some gauze, but not much</li><li>A package of second skin</li><li>Two single-use eye droppers</li><li>Two stainless steel safety pins (one big, one small)</li><li>A small quantity of triple antibiotic ointment</li><li>One nitrile glove</li><li>A miniature backup chapstick with sunscreen</li><li>A single course of ciproplaxen</li><li>Thirteen 500mg Vicodin pills</li><li>Eleven 600mg ibuprofen pills</li><li>Seven 120mg pseudoephedrine hydrocloride (Sudafed) pills</li><li>Six diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl) pills</li><li>Dosage and indication instructions for all of the above pills</li><li>A SOAP note (see attached for a sample - very important item)</li></ul>

Total weight is 124.7 grams (4.4 oz.). Don't take this as medical advice.
