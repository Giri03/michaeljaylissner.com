Well, it's a quiet Friday afternoon here in America, so that can mean only one thing: it's time for organizations to release whatever news they've been trying to keep quiet for the week. This weeks' big news is that a number of memos authorizing, rationalizing and generally condoning torture and interrogation <a href="http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&ncl=1334762857&topic=h" target="_blank">have been released to the ACLU</a>. 

There's a couple of interesting facts here.  The first is that <i>very</i> few of the 3,000 or so news articles about this topic seem to link to the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/olc_memos.html" target="_blank">ACLU site where the memos are prominently featured</a>.<sup>1</sup> I find this odd, and it gives me plenty of room for speculation. (Bad reporting? Laziness? Suppression? Something else?)

The second interesting thing is the quotes in the memos themselves. I haven't had a chance to read all the memos yet, but I didn't have any difficulty finding some good stuff. The memos begin with a classic "Top Secret" stamp, and go on to say things such as:<blockquote>...You would like to employ ten techniques...These ten techniques are: (1) attention grasp, (2) Walling, (3) facial hold, (4) facial slap (insult slap), (5) cramped confinement, (6) wall standing, (7) stress positions, (8) sleep deprivation, (9) insects placed in a confinement box, and (10) the waterboard</blockquote>
From a different memo:<blockquote>Detainees subject to sleep deprivation who are also subject to nudity as a separate interrogation technique will at times be nude and wearing a diaper. If the detainee is wearing a diaper, it is checked regularly and changed as necessary...</blockquote>

They go on from there with great detail about how the interrogations go down, with the conclusion of course being that these things don't constitute torture.

<sup>1</sup> The math was done crudely. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&ncl=1334762857&topic=h">Here's</a> a google search that turns up 2,890 hits on the topic, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&num=20&q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.aclu.org%2Fsafefree%2Fgeneral%2Folc_memos.html+interrogation+memo&btnG=Search">here's</a> one that searches for sites that link to aclu.org, and that have the words "interrogation memo". The method is crude, but the overlap is sparse.
