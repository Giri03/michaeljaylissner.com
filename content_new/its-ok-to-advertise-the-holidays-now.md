I noticed this year that the winter holiday advertising actually came <i><strong>before</strong></i> Halloween. I could be wrong, but didn't it used to be a faux pas to do this before Thanksgiving? 

Oh well, this is a few days late, but I just wanted to mention that it's officially OK to roll out last year's music and crank up the commerce pressure machine.
