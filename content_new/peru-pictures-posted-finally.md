Natalie and I finally posted our pictures from Peru. We both had cameras, so we ended the trip with about 1,500 pictures. After two weeks of adjusting, cropping, and deleting pictures, we've wittled it down to only 757 photos. 

I know, I know, that's one heck of a lot of photos, but we decided there were just too many that couldn't be deleted. 

We've posted the photos on Picassa, so if you're interested in seeing them, drop me a line, and we can get you permission to the album. 

Enjoy.<!--break-->
