I've been doing some thinking, and I think that my destiny* wants me to have a beard. Let's take a quick walk through my past, shall we? <br />
<br />
First, I was into woodworking. I described it as, &quot;My first great passion.&quot; Observe this picture. It's the first hit on google images for the word &quot;woodworker&quot;.
</p>

<br />
Next, after sort of putting woodworking aside for a while, I got really into hiking; thru hiking to be precise. This picture is the third or fourth hit for &quot;thru hiker&quot; on google images, but I hasten to add that it is the first hit that contains a picture of a person.

</p>
<p>
Finally, as you may have noticed, I'm pretty into Linux these days. It's could be a phase as well (we'll see), but observe this image, also pulled from google images. Admittedly it's not hit number one, but I don't count pictures of college kids or penguins out of principle.

<br />
So. It seems I should have a beard. There is a problem with this plan though, and to illustrate that problem, I have this picture of me, when I tried it for myself. Damn.

What will come after Linux? Will it be Lumberjack or hippie...time will tell.

*Destiny is a load of bunk, and we all know it deep down.
