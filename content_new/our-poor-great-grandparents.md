It's important to have perspective these days. Times are changing, you know, and it can be hard to keep track of how things used to be. In that vein, I found an interesting quote from 1978:<blockquote>Children who begin school today have probably listened to more music than their great grandparents heard in their entire lives.</blockquote>It's pretty hard to imagine music as such a treat, since I listen to it pretty much every day. 

This also reminds me of the Stravinky's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring" target="_blank">Rite of Spring</a>, which was so raucous that it caused riots. These days people get offended by rap, punk and video games (oh my!), and claim that they make children into little ne'er-do-wells. 

Riots though? I can't imagine music causing riots ever again.
