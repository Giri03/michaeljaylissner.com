I have finally been reconnected with my long-lost artwork. I painted this while I was in college, and summarily lost the picture of it somebody had given me. It's a rip off from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSb-nV8l2QY">a hilarious short by Don Hertzfeldt</a>.  I have missed this picture for so long.
