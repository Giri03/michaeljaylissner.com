Just a quick post today. For some time I've been using the Firefox <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8636">Long URL Mobile Expander</a>. It's a great add-on that expands the URLs from about <a href="http://longurl.org/services">two hundred URL shortening services</a> such as tinyurl.com and bit.ly. One problem it has though is that when you open certain files locally on your computer, it throws an error:<code lang="bash">
error: current_domain is null</code>

This is a pretty annoying error, and some kind person tracked it down and posted the fix in the comments. They did not, however, post an updated version of the add-on. So, attached to this message is the fixed version.

A second extension that I've been using for a long time is the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3818" target="_blank">Resizeable Textarea</a> add-on. It allows you to drag the edge of text areas and form fields so that you can make them as big (or small) as you like. Unfortunately, the author hasn't updated the add-on since 2006, so it doesn't work on recent versions of Firefox. This is easy to fix, so I updated this one as well, and attached it to this post. 

Enjoy.

<strong>EDIT:</strong> Per the creator's comments below, you can find an updated and fixed version of the Long URL Expander in experimental status here: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/8636#version-2" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/8636#version-2</a>.
<strong>EDIT 2, 10-2-2009:</strong> Turns out that the fixed version of Resizeable Textarea on the mozilla site doesn't actually work. An updated version is attached though.
