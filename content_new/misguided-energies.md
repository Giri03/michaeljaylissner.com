From <a href="http://www.rmi.org/images/PDFs/WTOE/WTOE.pdf" taarget="_blank"><i>Winning the Oil Endgame</i></a> (free login required):<blockquote>The average new U.S. light vehicle in 2003 had 24% more weight, 93% more horsepower, and 29% faster 0ï¿½60-mph time than in 1981, but only 1% more miles per gallon. If 1981 performance had instead stayed constant, light vehicles would have become 33% more efficient</blockquote>

It's not a bad read, but it is 300+ pages of dense work.<!--break-->
