There has been some talk in my family over the years about my great grandfather, Meyer Lissner. Over the holidays, I scanned some old photos, and discovered that he was quite the famous fellow. Below is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_ships" target="_blank">liberty ship</a> that was named after him in 1943.

I also learned that my grandfather donated a <strong>LOT</strong> of his papers to the Stanford Library as the <a href="http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf858006bb&chunk.id=did-1.8.1&brand=oac" target="_blank">Meyer Lissner Papers</a>. I haven't read up much on him yet, but he seems pretty influential to California history as part of a reform movement. 

Interesting stuff. I'm going to have to do some researching on this fellow one of these days.<!--break-->
