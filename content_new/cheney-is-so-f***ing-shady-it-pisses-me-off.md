Cheney is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jz2z92QFdgFrIMAJC-4GQcHOm3MgD955ETCO0" target="_blank">at work</a> to keep his records from becoming public as part of the National Archives when he goes out of office. <blockquote>"The vice president alone may determine what constitutes vice presidential records or personal records, how his records will be created, maintained, managed and disposed, and are all actions that are committed to his discretion by law."</blockquote>I can think of no reason why this would be necessary unless he's the shadiest person ever in office. Oh, right.

As an ex-government worker, I can testify to how ridiculous this is: It's really f***ing ridiculous.<!--break-->
