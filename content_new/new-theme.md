I've finally taken a moment to change the official theme of my site. I have thoughts about the change, but I can't share them, because to do so would be to bias the <a href="http://www.michaeljaylissner.com/poll/which-theme-should-we-roll-with">poll I've created here</a>.

So, that, in a nutshell is the question I have today. Do we roll with the new theme that you should be seeing now (if not, hit refresh), or do we roll with the old theme that can still be used if you log in and then edit your default theme to Garland.

After all those posts about elections, don't you want to vote? Go ahead, follow the link above. Share your opinion...
