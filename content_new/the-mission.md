Here's the mission folks. For the next month, I will do the following every day:<ul><li>I will jump a rope on average 500 times.</li><li>I will eat no hydrogenated oil</li><li>I will floss every day</li><li>I will avoid single-passenger car usage at all costs</li><li>I will read a book for at least one half hour</li></ul>

I started this on Monday, and so far so good. It's a lot for one day - especially the car and the jumprope thing.

Will report back (hopefully) in one month.
