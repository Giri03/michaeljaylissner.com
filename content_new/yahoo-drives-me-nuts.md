Title: Yahoo! Drives Me Nuts

I joined a yahoo group the other day, and I noticed that when Yahoo! shows my member information, it says I am three years younger than I am. "No problem" I thought to myself, "I'll just edit my information, surely I put in the wrong birthday."

I went into the member section, and (after giving them my password for the second time in two minutes) found where my birthday was listed as "on file." I clicked the edit button for that section, and in the resulting page, it again said that my birthday was "on file." It did not give me a way to change it.

Wondering how to change it, I decided to try the help tool. I searched for "change birthday," which gave me the response:<blockquote>Q: Why can't I change my birthdate, and why does it say, "on file"?
A: We use your birthdate as a security measure in case you forget your password. We would not be able to do so if you were able to change it.</blockquote>Great. Good work guys.
