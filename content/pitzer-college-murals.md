I have finally been reconnected with my long-lost artwork. I painted this 
while I was in college, and summarily lost the picture of it somebody had 
given me. It's a rip off from [a hilarious short][1] by Don Hertzfeldt.  

I have missed this picture for so long.

The rest of the murals at Pitzer, including a bronze sculpture by Peter 
Harper can be [found here][2].
