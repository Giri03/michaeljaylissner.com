I've been more aware of the happenings in the street lately after one roommate had his car stolen, another had hers broken into (they took a bag of coins), and my car was front-ended a week or two ago. I've learned some valuable lessons just by watching what people are doing.

<strong>1. I have a mattress, and live in Berkeley. How do I get rid of it?</strong>
Get a U-Haul. Go to Fairview St. Remove mattress from truck. Set it on the curb. Depart.

<strong>2. It's noon on a Sunday, and I've finished my breakfast. How do I dispose of my beer bottle?</strong>
First, find a storm drain in a gutter, preferably one with a metal grate. Smash the bottle, either with your foot or the grate. Using your foot, sweep the debris into the drain.

Seriously. This is what people do on my block. I just do not get it.
