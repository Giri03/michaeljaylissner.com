The lesson is this: Yahoo! doesn't use encryption on their webmail. I'll repeat that: YAHOO! DOESN'T USE ENCRYPTION ON THEIR WEBMAIL! 

I'm nothing short of shocked. I could have sworn that Yahoo! was a $26B company. Surely, SURELY they, of all people would see the importance and value of secure email, right? Nope. 

They've been offering free email since at least April of 1996 when they had their IPO. Somehow in the last 12 years they never secured the damned thing? What?
