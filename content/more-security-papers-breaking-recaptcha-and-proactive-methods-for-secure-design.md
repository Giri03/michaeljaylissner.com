Two more security papers today. 

In the first, <em>Breaking ReCAPTCHA</em> I discuss a few methods that ReCAPTCHAs can be hacked, and talk a bit about the ways that they were attacked by the Anonymous hacker group. I should mention at the outset that none of the approaches here are particularly useful though, and that ultimately, the hacker group beat ReCAPTCHA by simply out numbering it.

The second paper is a brief discussion of some approaches an organization might take when beginning a project in which security is a high concern. Essentially, it takes a chronological approach, from the start to the end of the project. 

Enjoy.
