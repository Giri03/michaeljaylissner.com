Two more security papers today. 

In the first, [**Breaking ReCAPTCHA**][1] I discuss a few methods that 
ReCAPTCHAs can be hacked, and talk a bit about the ways that they were 
attacked by the Anonymous hacker group. I should mention at the outset that
none of the approaches here are particularly useful though, 
and that ultimately, the hacker group beat ReCAPTCHA by simply out 
numbering it.

[The *second paper*][2] is a brief discussion of some approaches an 
organization might take when beginning a project in which security is a 
high concern. Essentially, it takes a chronological approach, 
from the start to the end of the project. 

Enjoy.
