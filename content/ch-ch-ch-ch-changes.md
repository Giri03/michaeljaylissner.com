Well, we got back from Peru on Sunday (pictures forthcoming), and today was my 
last day at work with the <a href="http://ehsd.org/comm000.html">Community 
Services Bureau</a> of Contra Costa County. 

I've never worked somewhere for so long - all in all,  it was about three 
years, during which time I progressed from Temp Clerk to Intermediate Clerk 
to Assistant Manager. You do gotta love working in government.

In a way, I've been planning on quitting since about December of 2006, when I 
first applied to go back to school. Now that it's a year and a half later, 
I'm surprised I'm not more excited or elated about this change. It's possible 
it hasn't sunk in yet because I have been on vacation for the past two weeks 
(and am used to not going to work), but ultimately, I feel pretty normal, 
which is odd.

Tomorrow is the first day of school at the <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu">Berkeley 
School of Information</a>. I've got my classes all set up, and I'm shocked at 
exactly how awesome the classes are. 

Here's the official list as of now:

 - Information Organization and Retrieval
 - Distributing Computing Applications and Infrastructure
 - Politics of Piracy
 - Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation
 - Computer Mediated Communication
 - Photovoltaic Materials: Modern Technologies
 - Metrics of Sustainability


A lot of classes, eh? It's 20 units as of now, so I am definitely going to drop a number of them. It's going to be hard to decide which to drop though. It's a three-way split between classes offered through Haas school of business, the Energy and Resources Group and the iSchool. I guess we'll see which float to the top.
