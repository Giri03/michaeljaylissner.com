I just read <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcrypto.stanford.edu%2FDRM2002%2Fdarknet5.doc&ei=VTLPSLfdG5m0sQOo1ciIBw&usg=AFQjCNHZkIYjxy6LnWvUSt6kGrZ3SYLMZQ&sig2=hz865qMKNfakTgDi4sUVpA">an interesting paper</a> written by some Microsoft engineers on the subject of the futures of darknets and illicit file sharing on the Internet. 

Pretty interesting stuff:<blockquote>...the darknet will be a competitor to legal commerce. From the point of view of economic theory, this has profound implications for business strategy: for example, increased security (e.g. stronger DRM systems) may act as a disincentive to legal commerce. Consider an MP3 file sold on a web site: this costs money, but the purchased object is as useful as a version acquired from the darknet. However, a securely DRM-wrapped song is strictly less attractive: although the industry is striving for flexible licensing rules, customers will be restricted in their actions if the system is to provide meaningful security.</blockquote>

It seems so obvious, yet...this paper was written several years ago. <!--break-->
