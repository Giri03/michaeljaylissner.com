If you want to get through security with a large knife, all you have to do is try to slip one through in your bag a few times over the course of a few days or weeks. 

Each time you fail, you act like an idiot ("oops!"), and give them the knife, proceeding without it to your airplane. Eventually, the guy watching the x-ray screen will miss the knife, you will proceed, and you will finally be able to cut your airplane steak.

I learned this lesson by accident when I nearly missed my plane. I had planned on checking my small bag with the knife in it, but when I arrived at the airport late (my fault), I could either miss my plane, or try to sneak the knife through.

Since I didn't want to miss my flight, I tried and succeeded to get the pictured knife through. Pretty amazing that a three inch blade can pass right by, eh?

I wonder if terrorists are patient...
