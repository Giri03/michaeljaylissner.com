I'm starting something new. I can't tell you what it is yet, but I'm very excited about it. It has nothing to do with anything you might be thinking that it is. Unless you already know what it is. Confused? Don't be. You'll find out what it is soon enough. For those of you that are wondering, no, this has nothing to do with my "Secret Skill" that I picked up while in Spain.

In other news, it's official - I'm going to Peru in August before starting at Cal. I had no idea Peru was so awesome. It's like a giant exaggerated California, except with jungle. They have massive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huacachina" target="_blank">sand dunes</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevado_Huascaran" target="_blank">4th highest mountain in the Americas</a>, the headlands for the Amazon River, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colca_Canyon" target="_blank">giant canyons</a> that make the grand canyon seem quaint, and so much adventure, I have no idea how to handle it. Also, did I mention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu" target="_blank">Machu Picchu</a>? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Titicaca" target="_blank">Lake Titicaca</a>?

More details to come on this craziness.<!--break-->
