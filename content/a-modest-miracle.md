Title: A Modest Miracle

I got an urge today to take some garlic and to take some rosemary, and to seep 
them in oil for a few days to make some bread dip. I had a strange quantity of
virgin oil and fresh peeled garlic on hand, but I lacked the rosemary, so I 
grabbed a friend and went walking in the neighborhood, looking for a garden to 
rob. 

We walked for a few blocks in the dark with a flashlight looking for rosemary, 
but we weren't finding any. We found some mint and some tomatoes in a garden 
near our house, but no rosemary. Then a nice lady walked by with something in 
her hand that looked like a plant. I said, "Hey, do you know any houses around 
here that might have rosemary?" She said, "&#191;necisita rosemary?" and held 
up the sprig she had in her hand. We chatted a bit, and she gave me a sprig off 
the plant she was bringing home. 

Now, I'm not a religious man, and in fact I don't believe in anything that 
can't be seen (ghosts, goblins, Zeus, god, angels, et al included). Sometimes 
I can see why others believe though. I mean, what are the odds? 

Upon arriving home, a roommate described it as, "A modest miracle." Indeed.
