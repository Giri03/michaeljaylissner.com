Well, it wasn't easy to figure this one out, but I have officially chosen to go to UC Berkeley. The reasons were many, but what it boiled down to in the end were four things:<ul><li>Price</li><li>Curriculum</li><li>Location</li><li>Reputation</li></ul>
These are usually summarized by the acronym PCLR (pronounced "Pickler"). 

I'm excited about having chosen Cal, though it was a very challenging decision. Obviously, my happiness for the next two years was at stake, but beyond that, it seems like my entire future was on the table. Check back with me in four years, we'll see how I'm doing...
