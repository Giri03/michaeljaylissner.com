Well, it wasn't easy to figure this one out, but I have officially chosen to 
go to UC Berkeley. The reasons were many, but what it boiled down to in the 
end were four things:

 - Price
 - Curriculum
 - Location
 - Reputation

These are usually summarized by the acronym PCLR (pronounced "Pickler"). 

I'm excited about having chosen Cal, though it was a very challenging 
decision. Obviously, my happiness for the next two years was at stake, but 
beyond that, it seems like my entire future was on the table. Check back with 
me in four years, we'll see how I'm doing...
