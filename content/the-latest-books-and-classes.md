Well, another semester has begun at the School of Information, and so I figured I'd share my latest classes and books.

As of now, I've boiled my classes down to the following:

 - Mixing and Remixing Information
 - Interface Aesthetics
 - Social and Organizational Issues of Information
 - Strategic Computing and Communications Technology
 - Information Law and Policy
 - Cyberlaw

And somehow, I only had to buy three books and four readers this semester, for a total of $315. Somehow, this is more than last semester when I had five books and four readers. Oh well. The books from this semester are:

 - Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy
 - Software and Internet Law
 - Pro Web 2.0 Mashups

So far, classes are going well, but at least one of them will need to get cut. It's going to be hard to decide, but luckily I don't have to for another few months.
