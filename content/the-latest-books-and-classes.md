}

Well, another semester has begun at the School of Information, and so I figured I'd share my latest classes and books.

As of now, I've boiled my classes down to the following:<ul><li>Mixing and Remixing Information</li>
<li>Interface Aesthetics</li>
<li>Social and Organizational Issues of Information</li>
<li>Strategic Computing and Communications Technology</li>
<li>Information Law and Policy</li>
<li>Cyberlaw</li></ul>

And somehow, I only had to buy three books and four readers this semester, for a total of $315. Somehow, this is more than last semester when I had five books and four readers. Oh well. The books from this semester are:
<ul><li>Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy</li>
<li>Software and Internet Law</li>
<li>Pro Web 2.0 Mashups</li></ul>

So far, classes are going well, but at least one of them will need to get cut. It's going to be hard to decide, but luckily I don't have to for another few months.
