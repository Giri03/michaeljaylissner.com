According to <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html">Title 17, Chapter 5, section 504c2 of the US copyright law</a>, if you get caught with music that you have downloaded illegally from the Internet, you can get charged up to $150,000 per infringement. I thought I would do a little experiment to see how much I would be in for if my entire collection were to be found to be illegal. 

Let's do some math. I have 3,876 tracks, at $150,000 each. So if my entire collection were to be found illegal, that means it would cost me $581.4 million dollars &mdash; about .6 billion dollars. 

OK, let's assume that I can live with that reality. It just seems odd that I could have bought those songs for $3,876 on amazon.com, or iTunes.

Something isn't quite right here. Also, did I mention that all US digital music sales <a href="http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_resources/dmr2008.html">are estimated</a> to total $2.9B in 2007? That makes my music worth about 20% of the 2007 revenue.
