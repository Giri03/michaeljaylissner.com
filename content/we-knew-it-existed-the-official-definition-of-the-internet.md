On October 24, 1995, the Federal Networking Council met and decided that the 
"Internet" refers to the global information system that:

1. is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on 
the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons;
1. is able to support communications using the Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent 
extensions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and
1. provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately, high level 
services layered on the communications and related infrastructure described 
herein.

Oh. Thanks for that.
