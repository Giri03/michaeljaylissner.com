On October 24, 1995, the Federal Networking Council met and decided that the "Internet" refers to the global information system that:<ol><li>is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons;</li>
<li>is able to support communications using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and</li>
<li>provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately, high level services layered on the communications and related infrastructure described herein.</li></ol>

Oh. Thanks for that.<!--break-->
