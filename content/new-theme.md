I've finally taken a moment to change the official theme of my site. I have
thoughts about the change, but I can't share them, because to do so would 
be to bias the poll I've created here **\[poll archived\]**.

So, that, in a nutshell is the question I have today. Do we roll with the 
new theme that you should be seeing now (if not, hit refresh), 
or do we roll with the old theme that can still be used if you log in and 
then edit your default theme to Garland.

After all those posts about elections, don't you want to vote? Go ahead, 
follow the link above. Share your opinion...
