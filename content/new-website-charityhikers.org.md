Just a quick post today to announce that I have finally figured out how to run a drupal multisite installation, and I have finally converted my old website, <a href="http://www.charityhikers.org">CharityHikers.org</a> over to Drupal. Making charityhikers.org a dynamically driven site has been one of my goals since about 2004, so completing this task is giving me an excellent dose of satisfaction. 

The site began as a place where I could put up information about my hike for AIDS research, but I have developed it into something that other people can use to fundraise for their own causes. With this step, I think it is finally getting pretty close to a useful tool, but I still have a couple of things I'd like to accomplish with the site.

The biggest goal I have for it is to allow hikers to sign up, and then update their profile with their charity and personal information, and to have that dynamically generate the menus, pages, etc. that are needed for the site so that their new information is automatically integrated. At present, pages have to be manually created through the CMS system, which is a bit of work, but it's not too bad all in all.

The second goal I have is to allow picture uploading for hikers. It doesn't take a whole lot of storage space to do this, and it seems like a good service to provide. My current plan is to use gallery2 to accomplish this feat, but I'm having some serious issues with the database right now.

Anyway, goals and road maps aside, I'm really quite happy with this change. My real goal is for this site to really start bringing in donations. So far it's brought in a little over $10K, but in the scheme of things that's really not a whole lot of money...
