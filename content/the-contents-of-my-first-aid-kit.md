I present to you approximately a decade's worth of first aid kit refinement. Emphasis is on completeness and lightness. Inside a custom silnylon envelope (with no zippers or fasteners that might slow down frostbitten, missing or otherwise failing hands), I have the following:

 - An ultra-fine tipped 0.5ml syringe
 - A 1ml glass vial of epinephren
 - One half sheet moleskin and a small quantity of mole foam
 - Ten butterfly adhesive bandages
 - One package steri-strips
 - Two 2" x 3" non-adhesive pads
 - Some gauze, but not much
 - A package of second skin
 - Two single-use eye droppers
 - Two stainless steel safety pins (one big, one small)
 - A small quantity of triple antibiotic ointment
 - One nitrile glove
 - A miniature backup chapstick with sunscreen
 - A single course of ciproplaxen
 - Thirteen 500mg Vicodin pills
 - Eleven 600mg ibuprofen pills
 - Seven 120mg pseudoephedrine hydrocloride (Sudafed) pills
 - Six diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl) pills
 - Dosage and indication instructions for all of the above pills
 - A SOAP note (see attached for a sample - very important item)


Total weight is 124.7 grams (4.4 oz.). Don't take this as medical advice.
