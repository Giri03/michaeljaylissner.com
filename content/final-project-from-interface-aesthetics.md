I had my last day of actual class today, and the semester is really 
beginning to wind down. I still have at least 60 pages of writing to do in 
the next two weeks, but somehow it will get done. One class that I 
<i>have</i> finished my final project work for is [Interface 
Aesthetics][1], which was a survey class covering typography, color, 
layout, web design, and a handful of other topics. 

For the final project, we each made [presentations of our work from the 
semester][2], and on Monday from 4:10 to 6pm we will be 
holding an [open house][3] to share our work at the iSchool. A lot of it
 is really quite good, though this presentation is what I will be showing, 
 so this is one cat that's out of the bag.

Some of the work in the attached could still use some refinement, 
but I will point you towards the ones titled "Type I," "Type II," 
and "Icons," which I think came out pretty well.
