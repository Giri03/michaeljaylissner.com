<p>I'm entering year number two of my plan to annually donate a small sum of money to a handful of organizations at the beginning of every year. This year I picked the organizations that had a major effect on me personally, are fixing environmental problems, or are working towards fixing the American political system. </p>

<p>You'll see that I've given the most money to organizations that are working to reform voting methods, and campaign finance. I believe that if those two things were fixed properly, we'd have good people in office that could fix all of the other issues we see from day to day.</p>
