Like the title says, every now and again, I have to rant about how annoying iPods (and by extension, Apple) are. This is one of those times.

The picture below represents the folder hierarchy of my 20GB iPod, as displayed in the Ubuntu Disk Analyzer:

Right now, this iPod is nearly full. I filled it with a very normal hodge-podge of songs. Naturally, I like some artists better than others, and so, I have more of their songs. The Beatles and Zeppelin, for example, I have a lot of. A-Ha, and Four Non Blondes, not so much. When this is the case, I'll have a folder filled with lots of songs - a big folder. If you look at the image above though, you'll see that my iPod is organized into 50 equal directories, named r1 to r50.

Now, why would Apple do this? Why would they take perfectly organized songs in neat and tidy folders and then split them into 50 folders with meaningless names? Because that makes it more of a pain in the butt to figure out what music is on the iPod, and in theory makes it harder to share the songs. For the copyright violators, this should slow them down. 

For the rest of the world, it's a pain, because rather than browsing our iPod like we would a normal music player, instead we must use iTunes, or, if we use Linux, reverse engineer the thing, which invariably doesn't work that well. 

Apple could have made a device that worked normally on all computers, like everybody else did, but instead they have locked us into iTunes, a weird directory structure, and a system designed to be as obscure as possible. Not cool.
