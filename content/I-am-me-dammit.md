Well, it happened. The bastards stole my identity. They somehow got my credit card number, address, phone number, etc, took them, and put them to use. Grand total losses: $309. Not too bad, considering.

I've called my credit card company, and they promise to reimburse me for my losses. This is when I thank the federal government for making them do this. Thank you feds!

I'm thinking about how this happened, and I have a theory. I am about 95% sure this happened as a result of shopping for car parts online. One of the retailers I went to (lost to me now) decided to share my contact information with a number of "partners" so that a part I was looking for could be found more easily. I ended up getting the part, but I think they might have shared more info than they should have. Arg. 

After all of the services that credit cards have tried to sell me over the years to protect me from this kind of thing, I'm happy to say that I'm fine without them. It's really not the end of the world...it's annoying though, yes.<!--break-->
