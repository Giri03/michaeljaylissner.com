Last semester I took a class at the UC Berkeley School of Business (Haas) 
entitled <i>Metrics of Sustainability</i>. It was an interesting class all 
in all, though frustrating at times because of the emphasis on making 
sustainability something that businesses will ***want*** to do. Our 
professor was a jocular fellow, though his history at large companies 
became evident in his notes on our final paper.

[The paper itself][1] is designed to set up metrics for analyzing the social, 
financial, and environmental sustainability of a company in the energy 
sector. The project was at once overly simple and overly complicated. On 
the one hand, it was really quite tempting to just write metrics like, 
"Did you damage the environment during the last year?" "Did you lose 
money?" On the other hand, writing complicated, and specific metrics was 
really the name of the game, and the hard part was finding the balance 
between the two. I was quite happy with the balance that we found, 
but our feedback was that our metrics were too complicated, 
and that there were too many of them. So it goes I suppose.

In any case, for those interested, [I have attached our metrics][1] for the 
energy sector to this post.
