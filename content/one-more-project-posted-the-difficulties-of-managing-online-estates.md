Well, one more paper down, one more to go! Today I completed the final paper 
for [my class on information law and policy][1], which was one of my best 
classes this semester. It was a pretty tough one that required a <i>lot</i> of 
reading and a lot of extra work for the assignments, but I found it quite 
rewarding in the end. 

The attached assignment is in a similar vein to the one I posted on Tuesday, 
but approaches the topic from a slightly different angle. The assignment in 
this case was to present an analysis of some of the policy problems that are 
raised by a project of our choice. Since I had already done a lot of thinking 
about the policy implications of how we handle online assets after a death, I 
decided to analyze some of the problems that are raised, and to postulate some 
solutions of my own.
