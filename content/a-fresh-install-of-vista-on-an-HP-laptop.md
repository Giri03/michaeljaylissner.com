I just used a recovery disk to install Vista on an HP laptop. I'm shocked by what it came with. Just looking at the desktop shows the following software that was installed without me even being able to stop it:

 - A shortcut to AOL Sign Up
 - Easy Internet Services
 - A shortcut to eBay
 - A "Get Vontage" shortcut
 - A High-Speed Services shortcut
 - HP Help and Support
 - HP Total Care Advisor
 - MS Office 60 Day Trial
 - A shortcut to MSN
 - My HP Games
 - Norton Antivirus
 - Photosmart Essential 2.0
 - Quickplay
 - Rhapsody
 - Vongo Free Trial
 - A giant Easy Sign-up dialog box
 - A Yahoo! search bar

Good god. And I paid for this? Unbelievable.
