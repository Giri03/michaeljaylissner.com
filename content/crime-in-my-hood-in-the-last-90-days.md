I did a little research today, and discovered some fun facts. Within one mile of my house, in the last 90 days there have been:

 - Arson: 1
 - Assault W/Deadly Wpn: 3
 - Barking Dog: 13
 - Burglary: 8
 - Burglary Auto: 54
 - Burglary-Com'l: 11
 - Burglary-Res'l: 49
 - Drunk In Public: 32
 - Grand Theft: 42
 - H & S Violation: 34
 - Homicide: 1
 - Loud Noise: 296
 - Malicious Damage: 32
 - Petty Theft: 96
 - Prostitution Activity: 33
 - Rape: 4
 - Robbery: 36
 - Stolen Vehicle: 59

Some of those are more striking than others. Like the four rapes, or the 59 stolen automobiles. Maybe the 3 assaults with deadly weapons. Or how about the nearly 300 noise complaints (in 90 days).

Jeesh.
