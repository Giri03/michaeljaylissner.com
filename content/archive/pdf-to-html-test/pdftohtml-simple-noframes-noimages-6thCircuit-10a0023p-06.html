<i>Balmert v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.</i><br>
Page 2<br>
of her claim&nbsp;and that Reliance Standard’s benefits determination was not arbitrary and<br>
capricious, we affirm.<br>
<b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
Balmert began her employment with Big Lots, Inc. as an accountant-tax analyst in<br>
2001. &nbsp;Her position required her to sit most&nbsp;of&nbsp;the day and manipulate her hands, fingers, and<br>
wrists to use a computer. &nbsp;As a Big&nbsp;Lots&nbsp;employee, Balmert subscribed to an employee<br>
benefit plan offering long-term&nbsp;disability insurance under a contract insured&nbsp;and<br>
administered by Reliance Standard.<br>
In August 2004, she stopped working because&nbsp;of symptoms&nbsp;she believed were related<br>
to her&nbsp;rheumatoid arthritis. &nbsp;Balmert was evaluated by her rheumatologist, Kevin V.<br>
Hackshaw,&nbsp;M.D.,&nbsp;on August 26, 2004, but the results of&nbsp;the examination were&nbsp;inconclusive.<br>
According to Dr. Hackshaw, Balmert described symptoms&nbsp;of&nbsp;pain&nbsp;in&nbsp;her&nbsp;hands, but “the pain<br>
<b>1</b><br>
that&nbsp;she complains&nbsp;of&nbsp;is&nbsp;disproportionate&nbsp;relative to&nbsp;the amount&nbsp;of&nbsp;synovitis&nbsp;that&nbsp;I see.”<br>
Noting that Balmert’s symptoms&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;“some other etiology”–with stress as a<br>
possibility–Dr. Hackshaw referred her to a neurologist and a psychologist and placed her<br>
on temporary medical leave in order to obtain evaluations and recommendations from<br>
his colleagues.<br>
On August 30, 2004, Balmert&nbsp;had her first consultation with her psychologist,<br>
Wanda McEntyre, Ph.D. &nbsp;Balmert told Dr. McEntyre that she had experienced pain from<br>
rheumatoid arthritis for a number of years, but her pain level had recently intensified.<br>
Dr. McEntyre noted that Balmert “expresses a strong desire to return to her job, but<br>
acknowledges that she does not perceive herself as capable of managing the hours, the<br>
pressure, and stress at this time.” &nbsp;Balmert began meeting with Dr. McEntyre<br>
approximately once every two weeks until she discontinued counseling in December<br>
2004. &nbsp;These counseling sessions generally focused on stress management techniques<br>
to prepare Balmert to return to work.<br>

<i>Balmert v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.</i><br>
Page 3<br>
After evaluating Balmert on October 21, 2004, Dr. Hackshaw noted that he<br>
detected “[n]o active synovitis,” that she was “doing well,” and that her rheumatoid<br>
arthritis &nbsp;“seems to be under good control.” &nbsp;Dr. Hackshaw also told Balmert&nbsp;that&nbsp;she<br>
could return to work with some&nbsp;limitations, but advised that she may wish to find a less<br>
stressful position or explore some&nbsp;type of flex&nbsp;plan that would allow her to take some&nbsp;of<br>
her computer typing work home. &nbsp;A few days later, Balmert tearfully expressed her<br>
concern to Dr. McEntyre regarding Dr. Hackshaw’s determination that she could return<br>
to work. &nbsp;At future counseling sessions, Balmert continued to express concerns about her<br>
ability to return to work.<br>
Following an evaluation of Balmert&nbsp;on February 10, 2005, Dr. Hackshaw noted<br>
that she had “no tender points and no synovitis that I could detect, so I think in general<br>
she is doing well.” &nbsp;Regarding Balmert’s work&nbsp;status, Dr. Hackshaw reported that “we<br>
had allowed her to return to work with limitations and they apparently stated that she<br>
would not be able to return to work due to the limitations.”<br>
After evaluating Balmert on May 19, 2005, Dr. Hackshaw noted that Balmert’s<br>
rheumatoid arthritis was “somewhat stable,”&nbsp;that she had “no synovitis,” and that she<br>
had “[f]ull&nbsp;range of motion of joints.” &nbsp;Dr. Hackshaw noted, after evaluating Balmert&nbsp;on<br>
August 18, 2005, that&nbsp;he&nbsp;was&nbsp;generally “pleased with how she is doing.” &nbsp;After<br>
evaluating Balmert on November 21, 2005, Dr. Hackshaw observed “[m]inimal<br>
synovitis” and stated that “she is doing well with current medications.”<br>
Balmert filed for long-term&nbsp;disability benefits on February 15, 2005. &nbsp;In a letter<br>
dated June 2, 2005, Reliance Standard denied Balmert’s claim&nbsp;for long-term&nbsp;disability<br>
benefits, stating that “there is no documentation of a physical condition that&nbsp;would<br>
preclude you from&nbsp;performing the material&nbsp;duties&nbsp;of your own occupation.” &nbsp;Balmert<br>
appealed Reliance Standard’s denial of her disability benefits. &nbsp;In&nbsp;support of her<br>
administrative appeal, Balmert provided Reliance Standard with additional medical and<br>
other information pertaining to her claim.<br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a>No. 08-4433<br>
<i>Balmert v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.</i><br>
Page 4<br>
The most important item&nbsp;submitted by Balmert in support of her appeal was a<br>
modified Functional Capacity Evaluation (“FCE”), conducted on March 15, 2006.<br>
Based on Balmert’s modified FCE, Matthew T. Crill, a physical therapist, stated: &nbsp;<br>
I do not believe it would be safe or&nbsp;prudent to place Ms. Balmert in any<br>type of formal work setting. &nbsp;This conclusion is&nbsp;based on her lack of<br>sitting tolerance, lack of standing tolerance, severe deficits in upper<br>extremity strength, severe deficits in fine motor skills, and chronic and<br>intractable subjective pain rating. &nbsp;She would not be able to perform&nbsp;any<br>of her previous work requirements&nbsp;under&nbsp;modified or full duty in the<br>context of a full work [day]. &nbsp;These recommendations are pending the<br>referring physician’s final evaluation.<br>
In a letter dated July 25, 2006, Dr. Hackshaw&nbsp;stated: &nbsp;“I have&nbsp;received a functional<br>
capacity evaluation on Ms. Balmert from&nbsp;March 15th 2006 and agree with the findings<br>
from&nbsp;this&nbsp;evaluation. &nbsp;I have been following Ms. Balmert since 2004 and would agree<br>
her condition was the same&nbsp;at that time as it is now.”<br>
After reviewing this material, Reliance Standard arranged for Balmert to be<br>
evaluated by an independent medical examiner, Marvin Thomas, M.D. &nbsp;On September<br>
29, 2006, Dr. Thomas reported:<br>
While the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis as mentioned seems firm<br>there is very little evidence of&nbsp;active disease and one would guess that it<br>is in relative remission. &nbsp;Prognosis is&nbsp;always uncertain in this disease but<br>looks reasonably good for her at this point. . . . &nbsp;I would place very little<br>limitation on her in terms of the use&nbsp;of her upper extremities. &nbsp;She might<br>have some&nbsp;difficulty because of her knees with prolonged standing and<br>negotiating steps. &nbsp;In summary while&nbsp;she has a diagnosis of rheumatoid<br>arthritis, it seems controlled. &nbsp;I see&nbsp;no reason why she cannot continue in<br>her present position.<br>
He also noted that “[t]here is no rheumatological basis for disability.” &nbsp;On November 2,<br>
2006, he supplemented his report with a statement that “[b]ased on the records that were<br>
sent to me&nbsp;it would appear initially that [Balmert] would have difficulty keyboarding and<br>
other use of her hands. &nbsp;Based on what I see now this would be much less of a problem.”<br>
After reviewing the&nbsp;record, Reliance Standard determined that Balmert would<br>
have been&nbsp;precluded from&nbsp;performing her own occupation for a closed period of time<br>
<hr>
<A name=5></a>No. 08-4433<br>
<i>Balmert v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.</i><br>
Page 5<br>
between August 26, 2004 to September 29, 2006. &nbsp;The determination to grant Balmert<br>
benefits for a closed period of time was&nbsp;evidently based on Dr. Thomas’s opinion that<br>
Balmert initially would have had difficulty keyboarding and with other use of her hands.<br>
Balmert was informed of the resolution of&nbsp;her administrative appeal by letter dated<br>
December 14, 2006. &nbsp;The letter states, in pertinent part: &nbsp;<br>
Since it has been established that&nbsp;total disability is supported from<br>August 26, 2004 to September 29, 2006, Ms. Balmert’s file has&nbsp;been<br>returned to the Claims&nbsp;Department&nbsp;to pay benefits up to the latter date<br>and then close the file on the basis that disability is not supported beyond<br>that date. . . . Please be advised that&nbsp;our claim&nbsp;decision is now final, as<br>Ms. Balmert has exhausted any administrative remedies available.<br>
Balmert filed an ERISA claim&nbsp;against Reliance Standard in district court on<br>
February 8, 2007, challenging the limited grant&nbsp;of long-term&nbsp;disability benefits. &nbsp;On<br>
September 22, 2008, the district court granted judgment on the administrative record in<br>
favor of Reliance Standard. &nbsp;The district&nbsp;court concluded that Reliance Standard’s<br>
determination of benefits was supported by substantial evidence.<br>
<b>STANDARD OF REVIEW</b><br>
We&nbsp;review de novo the district court’s ruling, applying the same&nbsp;legal standard<br>
as the district court. &nbsp;<i>Whitaker v. Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co.</i>, 404 F.3d 947, 949<br>
(6th Cir. 2005). &nbsp;Here, the district court appropriately applied the arbitrary-and-<br>
capricious standard of review because&nbsp;the benefit plan granted the ERISA plan<br>
administrator discretionary authority to interpret the terms of&nbsp;the plan and to determine<br>
eligibility for benefits. &nbsp;<i>See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.&nbsp;Bruch</i>, 489 U.S. 101, 115<br>
(1989);&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>see also Glenn v. MetLife</i>, 461 F.3d 660, 666 (6th Cir. 2006). &nbsp;Under the<br>
arbitrary-and-capricious standard, we will&nbsp;uphold a plan administrator’s decision “if it<br>
is the result of a deliberate, principled reasoning process and if it is supported by<br>
substantial evidence.”<i>&nbsp; Baker v. United Mine Workers of Am. Health &amp; Ret. Funds</i>, 929<br>
F.2d 1140, 1144 (6th Cir. 1991). &nbsp;However, as we have repeatedly&nbsp;stated, “the federal<br>
courts do not sit in review of the administrator’s decisions only for the purpose of rubber<br>
<hr>
<A name=6></a>No. 08-4433<br>
<i>Balmert v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.</i><br>
Page 6<br>
stamping those decisions.” &nbsp;<i>Moon v. Unum Provident Corp.</i>, 405 F.3d 373, 379 (6th Cir.<br>
2005).&nbsp;<br>
<b>DISCUSSION</b><br>
<b>A. &nbsp;Full and Fair Review</b><br>
29 U.S.C. § 1133 provides that every employee benefit plan must:<br>
(1) provide adequate notice in writing to any participant&nbsp;or beneficiary<br>whose claim&nbsp;for benefits under the plan&nbsp;has been denied, setting forth the<br>specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be<br>understood by the participant, and<br>
(2) afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim&nbsp;for<br>benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate<br>named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.&nbsp;<br>
The essential purpose of 29 U.S.C. § 1133 is twofold: &nbsp;“(1) to notify the claimant of the<br>
specific reasons for a claim denial, and (2) to provide the claimant an opportunity to<br>
have&nbsp;that&nbsp;decision reviewed by the fiduciary.” &nbsp;<i>Wenner v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of</i><br>
<i>Can.</i>, 482 F.3d 878, 882 (6th Cir. 2007) (emphasis&nbsp;omitted). &nbsp;Moreover, an administrator<br>
may not initially deny benefits for one reason, and then turn around and deny benefits<br>
for an entirely different reason, after an administrative appeal, without affording the<br>
claimant an opportunity to respond to the second, determinative reason for the denial of<br>
benefits. &nbsp;<i>Id</i>. at 882. &nbsp;<br>
Balmert argues that her administrative appeal was procedurally unfair because<br>
Reliance&nbsp;Standard’s final benefits determination was allegedly for a different reason than<br>
its initial benefits determination. &nbsp;This contention, however, is without merit. &nbsp;Reliance<br>
Standard’s June 2, 2005 letter to Balmert stated that the&nbsp;reason for denying long-term<br>
disability benefits was that “there is no documentation of a physical condition that would<br>
preclude you from&nbsp;performing the material duties of your own occupation.” &nbsp;Similarly,<br>
its December 14, 2006 letter to Balmert stated&nbsp;that the basis for denying continuing long-<br>
term&nbsp;disability benefits was that “disability is&nbsp;not supported beyond [September 29,<br>
2006].” &nbsp;In other words, benefits were initially denied based on a lack of evidence&nbsp;of<br>
<hr>
<A name=7></a>No. 08-4433<br>
<i>Balmert v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.</i><br>
Page 7<br>
disability, and continuing benefits were finally denied based on a lack of&nbsp;evidence of<br>
disability. &nbsp;This is not a case in which the&nbsp;administrator initially denied benefits for one<br>
reason and later denied benefits for&nbsp;another reason. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>id</i>. &nbsp;The fact that Balmert<br>
received benefits for a closed period does not alter the fact that Reliance Standard<br>
consistently and accurately notified her that&nbsp;benefits had been denied based on a lack of<br>
evidence supporting disability.<br>
Balmert also argues that her administrative appeal was procedurally unfair<br>
because she was not given the opportunity&nbsp;to respond to the independent medical<br>
examiner’s report. &nbsp;Relying on&nbsp;<i>Houston v. Unum Life Insurance Co. of America</i>, 246 F.<br>
App’x 293 (6th Cir. 2007) (unpublished), Balmert contends that “the persistent core<br>
requirements of review intended to be full&nbsp;and fair include knowing what evidence the<br>
decision-maker relied upon,<i>&nbsp;having an opportunity to address&nbsp;the&nbsp;accuracy and</i><br>
<i>reliability of that evidence</i>, and having the decision-maker consider the evidence<br>
presented by both parties prior to reaching and rendering his decision.” &nbsp;<i>Id</i>. at 300<br>
(emphasis in original) (quoting&nbsp;<i>Halpin v. W. W. Grainger, Inc.</i>, 962 F.2d 685, 689 (7th<br>
Cir. 1992)). &nbsp;Reliance Standard, quoting&nbsp;<i>Metzger v. Unum Life Insurance Co. of</i><br>
<i>America</i>, 476 F.3d 1161 (10th Cir. 2007), counters that:<br>
Permitting a claimant to&nbsp;receive and rebut medical opinion reports<br>generated in the course&nbsp;of an administrative appeal–even when those<br>reports contain no new factual information and deny benefits on the same<br>basis as the initial decision–would set up an unnecessary cycle of<br>submission, review, re-submission, and re-review. This would<br>undoubtedly prolong the appeal process, which, under the regulations,<br>should normally be completed within 45 days. &nbsp;Moreover, such repeating<br>cycles of review within a single appeal would unnecessarily increase cost<br>of appeals.&nbsp;<br>
<i>Id</i>. at 1166-67 (internal citations omitted). &nbsp;However, because Balmert did not attempt<br>
to rebut Dr. Thomas’s medical opinion, it is&nbsp;unnecessary for us to address the limits of<br>
a claimant’s right to rebut medical opinion reports generated in the course of an<br>
administrative appeal.&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=8></a>No. 08-4433<br>
<i>Balmert v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.</i><br>
Page 8<br>
It is sufficient for us to reiterate that,&nbsp;in the context of an administrative appeal<br>
of an adverse benefits determination, 29&nbsp;C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(h)(2) outlines the essential<br>
procedural requirements for a full and fair&nbsp;review. &nbsp;These&nbsp;procedural requirements<br>
include (1) the allowance of 60 days, after notification of an&nbsp;adverse benefit<br>
determination, in which a claimant may file&nbsp;an administrative appeal; (2) the opportunity<br>
to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the<br>
claim&nbsp;for benefits; (3) the right to be&nbsp;provided, upon request&nbsp;and free of charge,<br>
reasonable access&nbsp;to&nbsp;and&nbsp;copies&nbsp;of all documents, records, and other information relevant<br>
to the claim&nbsp;for benefits; and (4) the requirement that the fiduciary take into account all<br>
comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the claimant relating<br>
to the claim,&nbsp;regardless of&nbsp;whether such information was submitted or considered in the<br>
initial benefit determination. &nbsp;<i>Id</i>.&nbsp;<br>
A claimant’s failure to fully explore and exercise her procedural rights does not<br>
undermine the fundamental fairness of an otherwise full and fair administrative review<br>
process. &nbsp;Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(h)(2)(iii), Balmert had the right to receive<br>
a copy of Dr. Thomas’s report, but in order to exercise this right&nbsp;she was required to<br>
request a copy of the report.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;Id</i>. &nbsp;It is clear that Balmert had notice that Dr. Thomas<br>
would provide a medical evaluation in relation to her administrative appeal as Balmert<br>
was personally evaluated by Dr. Thomas during the course of the administrative appeal<br>
process. &nbsp;However, there is no evidence&nbsp;that she requested a copy of Dr. Thomas’s<br>
report.<b>2</b>&nbsp; Moreover, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(h)(2)(ii), Balmert had the right,<br>
during the course of&nbsp;her administrative appeal, to submit written comments, documents,<br>
records, and other information for the purpose of rebutting Dr. Thomas’s report or<br>
otherwise bolstering her claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Id</i>. &nbsp;There is, however, no indication that Balmert<br>
tendered any evidence for the purpose of rebutting Dr. Thomas’s report. &nbsp;In other words,<br>
in spite of&nbsp;the fact that Balmert knew that&nbsp;she had been evaluated by Dr. Thomas and<br>
that his report would be considered&nbsp;by Reliance Standard as part of the administrative<br>
appeal&nbsp;process, she did not take the opportunity to request a copy of the report&nbsp;or<br>
<b>2</b>Balmert received a copy of Dr. Thomas’s report as an appendix to Reliance&nbsp;Standard’s<br>
December 14, 2006 final determination letter.<br>

<i>Balmert v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.</i><br>
Page 9<br>
otherwise attempt to address the accuracy&nbsp;and reliability of&nbsp;Dr. Thomas’s medical<br>
findings. &nbsp;The fact that Balmert did not fully&nbsp;exercise her rights to receive and rebut Dr.<br>
Thomas’s medical opinion does not render her administrative appeal procedurally<br>
defective.&nbsp;<br>
<b>B. &nbsp;Benefits Determination</b><br>
Balmert argues that Reliance Standard’s&nbsp;final decision to grant benefits to<br>
Balmert for a closed period, August 26, 2004&nbsp;to September 29, 2006, but otherwise deny<br>
continuing long-term&nbsp;disability benefits, is&nbsp;arbitrary and capricious. &nbsp;We&nbsp;disagree.<br>
Balmert’s own physician, Dr. Hackshaw, stated on August 26, 2004 that “the pain that<br>
she complains of is disproportionate relative to the amount of synovitis that I see.”<br>
Finding no rheumatological basis for Balmert’s alleged symptoms, Dr. Hackshaw<br>
requested that she be evaluated by a neurologist and a psychologist. &nbsp;At follow-up<br>
appointments, Dr. Hackshaw’s evaluations of Balmert were consistently positive. &nbsp;On<br>
October 21, 2004, he told Balmert that she could return to work with certain limitations.<br>
His records indicate that he believed that&nbsp;Balmert had the capability to work at a<br>
computer, albeit on a more limited basis, as he suggested that she explore some&nbsp;type of<br>
flex plan that would allow her to take her computer typing work home.<br>
The findings of&nbsp;Dr. Thomas confirm&nbsp;Dr. Hackshaw’s initial observations. &nbsp;Dr.<br>
Thomas noted that Balmert’s rheumatoid arthritis seemed controlled and stated: &nbsp;“I see<br>
no reason why she cannot continue in her&nbsp;present position.” &nbsp;He also observed “no<br>
rheumatological basis for disability.” &nbsp;Dr. Thomas indicated that, at the time of&nbsp;his<br>
evaluation, Balmert had the capacity to perform&nbsp;keyboarding functions and otherwise<br>
use her hands. &nbsp;However, based on his review&nbsp;of Balmert’s&nbsp;medical records, he noted<br>
that she initially may have had difficulty keyboarding and with other use of her hands.<br>
Although there may have been sufficient evidence to support an outright denial of<br>
disability benefits,&nbsp;based&nbsp;on&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Thomas’s&nbsp;review&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;medical&nbsp;records,&nbsp;Reliance<br>
Standard granted benefits&nbsp;to&nbsp;Balmert&nbsp;for the closed period of August 26, 2004 to<br>
September 29, 2006.&nbsp;<br>
<hr>

<i>Balmert v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.</i><br>
Page 10<br>
The divergence of medical opinion between Dr. Thomas and Dr. Hackshaw<br>
primarily resulted from&nbsp;Balmert’s modified FCE. &nbsp;Based on the modified FCE, the<br>
physical therapist recommended that it would&nbsp;be unsafe to place Balmert in any type of<br>
formal work setting. &nbsp;This recommendation contradicted Dr. Hackshaw’s previous<br>
medical opinion that Balmert could return to work with some&nbsp;limitations. &nbsp;However, in<br>
a highly ambiguous statement, Dr. Hackshaw&nbsp;wrote that he agreed with “the findings<br>
from&nbsp;the evaluation” and stated: &nbsp;“I have been following Ms. Balmert since&nbsp;2004 and<br>
would agree her condition was the same&nbsp;at that&nbsp;time as it is now.” &nbsp;It is noteworthy that<br>
Dr. Hackshaw did not&nbsp;state that he agreed with the recommendations of the physical<br>
therapist. &nbsp;Moreover, it is unclear what&nbsp;Dr. Hackshaw meant by his statement that<br>
Balmert’s condition is “the same” as it was&nbsp;in 2004. &nbsp;Indeed, Balmert remained at work<br>
until August 2004; Dr. Hackshaw had consistently&nbsp;opined in 2004 that Balmert’s<br>
rheumatoid arthritis was under control, and he had told Balmert in October 2004 that she<br>
could return to work. &nbsp;Thus, it is reasonable to find that Dr. Thomas’s medical<br>
observations were more credible than Dr. Hackshaw’s ambiguous&nbsp;statement of<br>
agreement with the modified FCE.&nbsp;<br>
Under ERISA, plan administrators are not&nbsp;required to accord special deference<br>
to the opinions of treating physicians. &nbsp;<i>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord</i>, 538 U.S.<br>
822, 831 (2003). &nbsp;Moreover, ERISA does not impose a heightened burden of explanation<br>
on administrators when they reject a treating physician’s opinion. &nbsp;<i>Id</i>. &nbsp;Reliance on other<br>
physicians is reasonable so long as the administrator does not totally ignore the treating<br>
physician’s opinions. &nbsp;<i>See id</i>.<i>&nbsp;</i>at 834. &nbsp;The record indicates that Dr. Hackshaw’s medical<br>
observations were taken into consideration both by Reliance Standard and by Dr.<br>
Thomas. &nbsp;Moreover, there is no indication that Dr. Thomas’s medical observations were<br>
biased. &nbsp;In fact, Dr. Thomas’s medical observations accord with Dr. Hackshaw’s initial<br>
medical observations, and the apparent change in Dr. Hackshaw’s medical opinion is<br>
unexplained. &nbsp;Thus, it is not arbitrary and capricious for Reliance Standard to rely more<br>
on Dr. Thomas’s medical opinion.<br>

There are also strong indications in the administrative record that Balmert’s<br>
symptoms&nbsp;were&nbsp;related&nbsp;to&nbsp;stress&nbsp;rather&nbsp;than&nbsp;rheumatoid&nbsp;arthritis. &nbsp;Balmert viewed&nbsp;her<br>
position with Big Lots as a “high stress job,” and her family members told Dr. Hackshaw<br>
that&nbsp;they&nbsp;felt that the stress was exacerbating Balmert’s condition. &nbsp;Balmert’s<br>
conversations with Dr. McEntyre focused on the long hours at work and the&nbsp;demands<br>
that were placed upon her at home. &nbsp;Of particular importance, Dr. McEntyre noted that<br>
Balmert used complaints of pain to get help from&nbsp;her husband and sons. &nbsp;Thus, there is<br>
an evidentiary basis to conclude that Balmert may have overstated her symptoms&nbsp;or that<br>
her symptoms&nbsp;may have been real but unrelated to her rheumatoid arthritis. &nbsp;However,<br>
because the record was constructed solely to&nbsp;support disability on the basis of<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, there is insufficient record evidence&nbsp;to&nbsp;support a finding of<br>
disability on another basis.<br>
There is substantial evidence to support Reliance Standard’s benefits<br>
determination. &nbsp;Therefore, Reliance Standard’s benefits determination was not arbitrary<br>
and capricious. &nbsp;<i>See Baker</i>, 929 F.2d at 1144. &nbsp;<br>
