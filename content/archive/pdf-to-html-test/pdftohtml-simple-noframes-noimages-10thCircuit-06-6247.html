&nbsp;<br>
Steven Montrail Triplet, a state prisoner confined in the Oklahoma Department of&nbsp;<br>
Corrections&nbsp;(ODOC), pled guilty as an adult in state court to attempted escape from&nbsp;<br>
custody, a crime he was charged&nbsp;with on July 3, 2002, when&nbsp;he was seventeen years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
He filed a 28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition, claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel&nbsp;<br>
for failing to raise a seminal issue—whether&nbsp;the adult court had jurisdiction because he&nbsp;<br>
was a juvenile. &nbsp;The district court denied&nbsp;the petition. &nbsp;We granted a certificate of&nbsp;<br>
appealability (COA) and now affirm. &nbsp;<br>

<b>OVERVIEW OF OKLAHOMA LAW&nbsp;</b><br>
A juvenile (one under the age of 18)&nbsp;alleged to have committed a crime in&nbsp;<br>
Oklahoma can be held&nbsp;accountable as (1) a child,&nbsp;(2) a youthful offender or (3) an adult. &nbsp;<br>
If the juvenile is to be treated as a child,&nbsp;the case proceeds in the juvenile division&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<br>
district court. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, §§&nbsp;7301-1.3(4), 7303-4.3(A) (2000).1&nbsp; If the&nbsp;<br>
court finds the allegations against the juvenile to be supported by the evidence, it enters&nbsp;<br>
an order of adjudication declaring the juvenile delinquent. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7303-4.6(A). &nbsp;An&nbsp;<br>
adjudicated delinquent shall not&nbsp;“be deemed a criminal” nor&nbsp;is he subject to the civil&nbsp;<br>
disabilities which normally follow a criminal conviction. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7307-1.7(A).&nbsp;<br>
Some&nbsp;juveniles are required to be treated&nbsp;as youthful offenders due to their age&nbsp;<br>
and criminal conduct.2&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;<i>id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7306-2.6(A), (B). &nbsp;If so treated, the case proceeds in the&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
1&nbsp;For this discussion only, we cite to&nbsp;the 2000 version of the Oklahoma Code&nbsp;<br>
which was in effect when Triplet pled guilty to robbery with&nbsp;a firearm, even though his&nbsp;<br>attempted escape conviction did not occur until 2002. &nbsp;The&nbsp;differences between the 2000&nbsp;<br>and 2002 versions are insignificant for our purposes. &nbsp;Our&nbsp;remaining discussion will refer&nbsp;<br>to the version in effect at the time of the relevant offense,<i>&nbsp;see Bowman v. State</i>, 789 P.2d&nbsp;<br>631, 631 (Okla. Crim. App. 1990) (“It is&nbsp;a well established rule of law that the&nbsp;<br>appropriate criminal penalty is&nbsp;the penalty in effect at the time the defendant commits the&nbsp;<br>crime.”), or the relevant procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>See Salazar v. State</i>, 852 P.2d 729, 737-38 (Okla.&nbsp;<br>Crim. App. 1993).&nbsp;<br>
2&nbsp;Oklahoma&nbsp;adopted its Youthful Offender Act&nbsp;on January 1, 1998, “to better&nbsp;<br>
ensure the public safety by&nbsp;holding youths accountable for the commission of serious&nbsp;<br>crimes, while affording courts methods of&nbsp;rehabilitation for those youths the courts&nbsp;<br>determine . . . may be amenable to such methods” and “to allow those youthful offenders&nbsp;<br>whom the courts find to be amenable to rehabilitation . . . to be placed in the custody or&nbsp;<br>under the supervision of the Office of Juvenile Affairs for the purpose of accessing the&nbsp;<br>rehabilitative programs provided by that Office and thereby, upon good conduct and&nbsp;<br>successful completion of such programs, avoid conviction for a crime.” &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat.&nbsp;<br>Ann. tit. 10, § 7306-2.2(B) (2000);&nbsp;<i>see also</i>&nbsp;<i>G.G. v. State</i>, 989 P.2d 936, 937-38 (Okla.&nbsp;<br>Crim. App. 1999).&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=3></a>criminal division&nbsp;of the district court (adult court) and the juvenile is treated in much the&nbsp;<br>
same manner as that of an adult. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7306-2.4(A)-(C);&nbsp;<i>see also In re M.B.</i>, 145 P.3d&nbsp;<br>
1040, 1047 (Okla. 2006) (“All the rights, protections, and procedures surrounding a&nbsp;<br>
criminal trial are in place in a trial of a youthful offender.”). &nbsp;Upon&nbsp;a finding or admission&nbsp;<br>
of guilt, the juvenile is sentenced as&nbsp;a youthful&nbsp;offender in the “manner provided by law&nbsp;<br>
for an adult for punishment of the offense committed” but the sentence may not exceed&nbsp;<br>
ten years.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>Okla. Stat. Ann. tit.10, § 7306-2.9(B);&nbsp;<i>see also</i>&nbsp;<i>In re M.B.</i>, 145 P.3d at 1047. &nbsp;<br>
However, unlike an adult who is sentenced to&nbsp;the county jail or&nbsp;to the custody or&nbsp;<br>
supervision of the Oklahoma Department of&nbsp;Corrections&nbsp;(ODOC), a juvenile tried and&nbsp;<br>
convicted as a youthful&nbsp;offender will generally&nbsp;be sentenced to the custody (juvenile&nbsp;<br>
facility) or supervision (probation) of&nbsp;the Office of Juvenile Affairs. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann.&nbsp;<br>
tit. 10, §§ 7306-2.6(F), 7306-2.9(A), (B),&nbsp;7306-2.10(A), (B);<i>&nbsp;</i>Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, §&nbsp;<br>
991a(A). &nbsp;The Office of Juvenile Affairs&nbsp;must prepare a rehabilitation plan for the&nbsp;<br>
juvenile providing (1) the juvenile facility where the juvenile will be placed (if&nbsp;<br>
applicable), (2) the objectives the juvenile is expected to achieve and (3) the services the&nbsp;<br>
juvenile will be provided to assist him in achieving those objectives. &nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit.&nbsp;<br>
10, § 7306-2.10(A).&nbsp;<br>
The court will review the juvenile’s compliance with his rehabilitation plan at least&nbsp;<br>
semi-annually. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7306-2.10(B). &nbsp;If, upon a hearing,&nbsp;the court decides the juvenile has&nbsp;<br>
reasonably complied with his&nbsp;rehabilitation plan and the public’s safety will not be&nbsp;<br>
jeopardized, the court may discharge the juvenile without a judgment of guilt and order&nbsp;<br>
- 3 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a>the verdict or plea expunged. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7306-2.10(F)(1).3&nbsp; If, on the other hand, the court&nbsp;<br>
determines the juvenile has&nbsp;(1) seriously&nbsp;injured or endangered another person by his&nbsp;<br>
violent behavior, (2) escaped from&nbsp;a training school, (3) committed a&nbsp;felony while in the&nbsp;<br>
custody or under the supervision of the Office of Juvenile Affairs or (4) failed to&nbsp;<br>
substantially comply with his written rehabilitation plan, the court may enter a judgment&nbsp;<br>
of guilt and transfer the juvenile&nbsp;to the county jail or to the&nbsp;custody and supervision of the&nbsp;<br>
ODOC. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7306-2.10(F)(5);<i>&nbsp;see also</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 991a(A). &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
In general, once a juvenile is prosecuted&nbsp;and sentenced as&nbsp;a youthful&nbsp;offender, he&nbsp;<br>
will continue to be prosecuted as a youthful offender in&nbsp;all subsequent criminal&nbsp;<br>
proceedings until he reaches eighteen. &nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 7306-2.4(G). &nbsp;Prior to&nbsp;<br>
reaching eighteen, he will&nbsp;only be treated as an adult in&nbsp;subsequent matters if (1) the&nbsp;<br>
court had previously determined, after a hearing and investigation, he should&nbsp;receive an&nbsp;<br>
adult sentence because&nbsp;he would not reasonably&nbsp;comply with a rehabilitation plan or the&nbsp;<br>
public would not be adequately protected if&nbsp;he were to receive a youthful offender&nbsp;<br>
sentence or (2) the court certifies him to stand trial as an&nbsp;adult. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§§ 7306-2.4(F), 7306-<br>
2.8(A)-(E). &nbsp;<br>
A juvenile may, and sometimes must, be tried as an adult. &nbsp;A juvenile may be&nbsp;<br>
certified to stand trial as an adult by the court after it considers determining factors such&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
3&nbsp;The statutes sometimes refer to the Department of Juvenile Justice, which is the&nbsp;<br>
branch of the Office of Juvenile Affairs responsible for&nbsp;the programs&nbsp;and services&nbsp;<br>provided&nbsp;to juveniles alleged or adjudicated delinquent. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, §&nbsp;<br>7302-2.2(A)(1) (2000). &nbsp;To avoid confusion, we refer&nbsp;only to the Office of Juvenile&nbsp;<br>Affairs.&nbsp;<br>
- 4 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=5></a>as the seriousness of the offense, whether&nbsp;the offense was committed against persons or&nbsp;<br>
property, the juvenile’s sophistication and maturity, his previous record and the&nbsp;<br>
likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile in the juvenile system. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7303-<br>
4.3(B). &nbsp;Juveniles over thirteen years old accused of certain serious crimes are required&nbsp;<br>
by statute to be tried as adults. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7306-1.1(A), (B). &nbsp;If the juvenile is to be treated as&nbsp;<br>
an adult, the case proceeds as&nbsp;a criminal action in the district court (adult court) and if&nbsp;<br>
convicted, the juvenile may be sentenced to&nbsp;the county jail or the&nbsp;custody or supervision&nbsp;<br>
of&nbsp;the ODOC. &nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;</i>Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 991a(A). &nbsp;<br>
<b>II.&nbsp;</b><br>
<b>STATE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS&nbsp;</b><br>
The facts of this case are convoluted because of the number of&nbsp;crimes committed&nbsp;<br>
by Triplet. &nbsp;We recite only those&nbsp;facts pertinent to our decision.&nbsp;<br>
On October 18, 2000, Triplet,&nbsp;then fifteen years old, pled guilty to robbery with a&nbsp;<br>
firearm in Oklahoma state court.4&nbsp; Due to his age and the&nbsp;nature of his offense, he was&nbsp;<br>
required to&nbsp;be treated as a youthful&nbsp;offender under Oklahoma&nbsp;law. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann.&nbsp;<br>
tit. 10, § 7306-2.6(A)(5)&nbsp;(2000) (“Any person fifteen . .&nbsp;. years of age who is charged&nbsp;<br>
with . . . [r]obbery with&nbsp;a firearm&nbsp;or attempt thereof . . . shall be held accountable for his&nbsp;<br>
acts as a youthful offender). &nbsp;He was sentenced&nbsp;to ten years in the custody of the Office&nbsp;<br>
of Juvenile Affairs. &nbsp;On&nbsp;November 15,&nbsp;2000, the parties adopted a written plan of&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
4&nbsp;In several documents in the&nbsp;record, Triplet’s plea is referred to as a plea of nolo&nbsp;<br>
contendere and his offense as&nbsp;attempted robbery with a firearm. &nbsp;However, because the&nbsp;<br>court document imposing sentence states Triplet pled guilty to robbery with a firearm, we&nbsp;<br>defer to it. &nbsp;In any event, we need not resolve the discrepancy because it is irrelevant to&nbsp;<br>our analysis.&nbsp;<br>
- 5 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=6></a>rehabilitation. &nbsp;Pursuant to that plan, Triplet was placed in a juvenile facility.&nbsp;<br>
On August 3, 2001, Triplet was paroled from the juvenile facility. &nbsp;When he&nbsp;<br>
violated the conditions of his parole, he was placed in the county jail.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>On July 3, 2002,&nbsp;<br>
while in custody, Triplet, then seventeen years old, attempted to escape. &nbsp;Sixteen days&nbsp;<br>
later, on July 19, 2002,&nbsp;the State charged him as an adult with attempted escape from&nbsp;<br>
custody. &nbsp;However, because he was not certified to stand trial as an adult and had not&nbsp;<br>
previously received an adult sentence, he should have been treated&nbsp;as a youthful&nbsp;offender&nbsp;<br>
in the attempted escape case. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, §&nbsp;7306-2.4(F), (G) (2002) (“A .&nbsp;<br>
. . youthful offender shall be tried as an adult in all subsequent criminal prosecutions&nbsp;<br>
[only]&nbsp;if: 1. The . . . youthful offender has been&nbsp;certified to stand trial as an adult . . . ; or&nbsp;<br>
2. The youthful offender has been certified for the imposition of an adult sentence as&nbsp;<br>
provided by [§] 7306-2.8 of this title and is subsequently convicted of the alleged offense&nbsp;<br>
. . . .”) &nbsp;<br>
Apparently, Triplet was released from custody after being charged with attempted&nbsp;<br>
escape as he went on to commit new crimes&nbsp;in March, September and November 2003,&nbsp;<br>
including possession of a controlled dangerous substance (cocaine), conspiracy to&nbsp;<br>
commit a felony (armed robbery), concealing stolen property and obstructing an&nbsp;officer,&nbsp;<br>
false declaration of ownership to&nbsp;a pawnbroker and uttering&nbsp;two or more bogus&nbsp;checks. &nbsp;<br>
He was charged with these offenses in the district court (adult court) sometime in 2003&nbsp;<br>
(after he had turned 18).&nbsp;<br>
On May 19, 2004, Triplet&nbsp;(then nineteen) pled guilty&nbsp;in adult court to the&nbsp;<br>
attempted escape from custody charge and the&nbsp;2003 charges. &nbsp;He was sentenced to two&nbsp;<br>
- 6 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=7></a>years imprisonment in the ODOC&nbsp;on the attempted escape charge. &nbsp;Relevant here, that&nbsp;<br>
sentence was ordered to run concurrent with&nbsp;several sentences he received on the 2003&nbsp;<br>
charges, the longest of&nbsp;which was ten years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Triplet was also sentenced to two ten-year&nbsp;<br>
sentences (eight years suspended)&nbsp;on the 2003 charges. &nbsp;These sentences were ordered to&nbsp;<br>
run concurrent with each other but consecutive to the concurrent series containing the&nbsp;<br>
attempted escape sentence (<i>i.e.</i>, after he completed ten years).<b>&nbsp;</b><br>
Triplet immediately sought to withdraw his plea, alleging the district attorney&nbsp;<br>
intimidated and coerced him into&nbsp;pleading guilty. &nbsp;The trial court denied relief on June 1,&nbsp;<br>
2004. &nbsp;Triplet, represented by counsel, appealed by filing a petition for writ of certiorari&nbsp;<br>
with the OCCA,5&nbsp;arguing the trial court abused its&nbsp;discretion by not allowing him&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>
withdraw his guilty plea, his sentence was excessive, his plea was not knowing or&nbsp;<br>
voluntary, and he was denied due process and&nbsp;equal protection of the&nbsp;law. &nbsp;On November&nbsp;<br>
18, 2004, the OCCA denied the petition and affirmed the judgment.&nbsp;<br>
<b>III.&nbsp;</b><br>
<b>STATE POST-CONVICTION&nbsp;RELIEF PROCEEDINGS&nbsp;</b><br>
On November 18, 2005, and&nbsp;again on November 6, 2006, Triplet filed for post-<br>
conviction relief in state court challenging his&nbsp;attempted escape conviction. &nbsp;He alleged&nbsp;<br>
that because he was under the age of eighteen at the time he was charged with attempting&nbsp;<br>
to escape and was never certified to be tried&nbsp;as an adult, his attempted escape conviction&nbsp;<br>
was void and his right&nbsp;to due&nbsp;process violated, notwithstanding that he was nineteen&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
5&nbsp;Under Oklahoma law, “all appeals taken&nbsp;from any conviction on a plea of guilty&nbsp;<br>
shall be taken by petition for writ of certiorari&nbsp;to the Court of Criminal Appeals.” &nbsp;Okla.&nbsp;<br>Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1051(A) (2004).&nbsp;<br>
- 7 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=8></a>when he pled guilty.6&nbsp; Additionally, he claimed his appellate counsel was ineffective for&nbsp;<br>
failing to raise the lack&nbsp;of adult certification on appeal.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>The state court denied relief on&nbsp;<br>
January 11,&nbsp;2006.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>The&nbsp;OCCA&nbsp;affirmed on March 23, 2006. &nbsp;After setting forth Triplet’s&nbsp;<br>
claims, the OCCA stated in relevant part:&nbsp;<br>
[A]ll issues previously&nbsp;ruled upon by this Court are&nbsp;<i>res judicata</i>, and all&nbsp;<br>issues not raised in the direct appeal&nbsp;[of the Attempted Escape conviction],&nbsp;<br>which could have been&nbsp;raised, are waived . . . .&nbsp;<br>
Petitioner argues he was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel&nbsp;<br>because appellate counsel did not&nbsp;raise issues Petitioner believes should&nbsp;<br>have been raised on direct appeal. &nbsp;Failure to raise each and every issue is&nbsp;<br>not determinative of ineffective assistance of counsel and counsel is not&nbsp;<br>required to&nbsp;advance every cause of argument regardless of merit. &nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;<br>Cartwright v. State</i>, 1985 OK CR 136, ¶¶ 6-8, 708 P.2d 592. &nbsp;The record&nbsp;<br>does not support Petitioner’s&nbsp;contention he was denied&nbsp;effective assistance&nbsp;<br>of appellate counsel.&nbsp;<br>
(R. Doc. 10-9 at 1-2.)<b>&nbsp;</b><br>
<b>IV.&nbsp;</b><br>
<b>FEDERAL HABEAS PROCEEDINGS&nbsp;</b><br>
Triplet filed this timely&nbsp;pro se 28 U.S.C.&nbsp;§ 2254 habeas petition attacking his&nbsp;<br>
attempted escape conviction. &nbsp;He alleged (1) the state district court&nbsp;lacked jurisdiction to&nbsp;<br>
try him as an adult on the attempted escape&nbsp;charge because he was seventeen when he&nbsp;<br>
was charged with the offense and he was never&nbsp;certified to stand trial as an adult and (2)&nbsp;<br>
appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to&nbsp;contact him to determine which issues he&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
6&nbsp;In his pro se&nbsp;brief, Triplet said that&nbsp;because he was seventeen when he committed&nbsp;<br>
the offense, the adult court lacked jurisdiction to&nbsp;try him&nbsp;as an adult. &nbsp;However, the&nbsp;<br>statutes requiring juveniles of certain ages to&nbsp;be treated as a youthful&nbsp;offender or an adult&nbsp;<br>refer to the juvenile being charged. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 10,&nbsp;§§ 7306-1.1(A), (B),&nbsp;<br>7306-2.6(A), (B). &nbsp;We need not resolve the issue because&nbsp;Triplet was seventeen when he&nbsp;<br>committed the offense and at the time he was charged. &nbsp;For simplicity purposes, we refer&nbsp;<br>solely to when Triplet was charged.&nbsp;<br>
- 8 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=9></a>wished to&nbsp;raise on direct appeal. &nbsp;The&nbsp;petition was referred to a magistrate judge.&nbsp;<br>
The magistrate judge recommended the petition be denied. &nbsp;Relevant here, the&nbsp;<br>
magistrate determined the OCCA, in rejecting Triplet’s ineffective assistance of appellate&nbsp;<br>
counsel claim, necessarily concluded he was not entitled to consideration as a youthful&nbsp;<br>
offender on the attempted escape charge under Oklahoma law.&nbsp;&nbsp;The magistrate stated: &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The [OCCA] is the arbiter of&nbsp;Oklahoma law, and the improper&nbsp;<br>interpretation of state law does not support a federal habeas case. &nbsp;<br>Jurisdiction is no exception to the general rule that federal courts will not&nbsp;<br>engage in collateral review of state&nbsp;court decisions based on state law . . .&nbsp;<br>we are bound by a state court’s conclusion respecting jurisdiction.&nbsp;<br>
(R. Doc. 14 at 10 (quotations omitted).) &nbsp;Over&nbsp;Triplet’s objection, the district court&nbsp;<br>
adopted the&nbsp;magistrate’s recommendation and&nbsp;entered judgment accordingly. &nbsp;Triplet&nbsp;<br>
filed a notice of appeal&nbsp;which the district court construed as a request for a COA. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<br>
court denied the request for a COA, as well&nbsp;as Triplet’s subsequent motion to proceed&nbsp;<i>in&nbsp;</i><br>
<i>forma pauperis</i>&nbsp;(<i>ifp</i>) on appeal.&nbsp;<br>
Triplet renewed his request for a COA with&nbsp;this Court. &nbsp;We concluded he was&nbsp;<br>
entitled to a COA on his ineffective assistance of appellate&nbsp;counsel claim and ordered the&nbsp;<br>
State to file a brief addressing: (1) whether&nbsp;Triplet’s guilty plea to the attempted escape&nbsp;<br>
charge constituted a waiver of his objection&nbsp;to a lack of adult certification and (2)&nbsp;<br>
whether Triplet’s claim that the State did not comply with&nbsp;Oklahoma law in sentencing&nbsp;<br>
him as an adult is cognizable&nbsp;in a 28 U.S.C. § 2254 proceeding. &nbsp;After receiving the&nbsp;<br>
State’s brief and Triplet’s reply, we appointed counsel to represent Triplet and requested&nbsp;<br>
supplemental briefing on the issues raised in&nbsp;our order granting a COA and those raised&nbsp;<br>
in the State’s brief. &nbsp;Additionally, because it&nbsp;appeared Triplet had served his attempted&nbsp;<br>
- 9 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=10></a>escape sentence at the time he filed his § 2254 petition, we directed the supplemental&nbsp;<br>
briefing to address whether Triplet was “in&nbsp;custody” on the attempted escape charge at&nbsp;<br>
the time he filed his § 2254 petition.&nbsp;<br>
<b>V.&nbsp;</b><br>
<b>&nbsp;DISCUSSION&nbsp;</b><br>
Our review is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of&nbsp;<br>
1996 (“AEDPA”). &nbsp;When the state court has&nbsp;adjudicated a claim on the merits, we may&nbsp;<br>
grant relief only if the state court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an&nbsp;<br>
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the&nbsp;<br>
Supreme Court of the United States” or “resulted in a decision that was based on an&nbsp;<br>
unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State&nbsp;<br>
court proceeding.” &nbsp;28 U.S.C.&nbsp;§ 2254(d). &nbsp;In this case,&nbsp;the OCCA rejected Triplet’s&nbsp;<br>
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim&nbsp;but did not&nbsp;explain why. &nbsp;Nevertheless,&nbsp;<br>
its decision constituted an “adjudication on&nbsp;the merits,” and we must defer to the&nbsp;<br>
OCCA’s result, even though its reasoning is not expressly stated. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;<i>Gipson v. Jordan</i>,&nbsp;<br>
376 F.3d 1193, 1196 (10th Cir. 2004).&nbsp;<br>
Because no Supreme Court precedent suggests application of a different standard,&nbsp;<br>
Triplet’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is&nbsp;controlled by the&nbsp;general&nbsp;<i>Strickland</i>7&nbsp;<br>
standard. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;<i>Knowles v. Mirzayance</i>, --U.S.--, 129 S. Ct. 1411,&nbsp;1419 (2009) (“[T]his&nbsp;<br>
Court has repeatedly applied [the&nbsp;<i>Strickland</i>]&nbsp;standard to evaluate&nbsp;ineffective-assistance-<br>
of-counsel claims where there is no&nbsp;other&nbsp;Supreme Court precedent directly on point.”);&nbsp;<br>

<A name=11></a><i>see also Wright v. Van Patten,&nbsp;</i>552 U.S. 120, 124-26 (2008)&nbsp;(evaluating ineffective&nbsp;<br>
assistance of counsel claim&nbsp;under&nbsp;<i>Strickland</i>&nbsp;where no Supreme Court precedent&nbsp;<br>
established any other standard&nbsp;applied). &nbsp;When evaluating an&nbsp;ineffective assistance of&nbsp;<br>
counsel claim&nbsp;under § 2254(d)(1), our review&nbsp;is “doubly deferential”—we defer to the&nbsp;<br>
state court’s determination that counsel’s performance was not deficient and further defer&nbsp;<br>
to the attorney’s decision in how best to&nbsp;represent a client. &nbsp;<i>Knowles</i>, 129 S. Ct. at 1420;&nbsp;<br>
<i>Yarborough v. Gentry</i>, 540 U.S. 1, 5-6 (2003). &nbsp;<br>
Yet a third level of deference applies. &nbsp;Whether appellate counsel is&nbsp;<br>
constitutionally ineffective for failing to raise a claim requires&nbsp;us to examine the merits of&nbsp;<br>
the omitted claim:&nbsp;<br>
If the omitted [claim] is so plainly&nbsp;meritorious that it would have been&nbsp;<br>unreasonable to winnow it out even from an otherwise strong appeal, its&nbsp;<br>omission may directly establish deficient performance; if the omitted&nbsp;<br>[claim] has merit but is not so&nbsp;compelling, the case for deficient&nbsp;<br>performance is more complicated, requiring an assessment of the issue&nbsp;<br>relative to the rest of the appeal, and deferential consideration must be&nbsp;<br>given to any professional judgment involved in its omission; of course, if&nbsp;<br>the [claim] is meritless, its omission will not constitute deficient&nbsp;<br>performance.&nbsp;<br>
<i>See Cargle v. Mullin</i>, 317 F.3d 1196, 1202 (10th Cir. 2003). &nbsp;In this case, the merits of&nbsp;<br>
the omitted claim—whether the adult court had jurisdiction to take Triplet’s plea and&nbsp;<br>
sentence him in the attempted escape case—is&nbsp;a question of state law to which we are&nbsp;<br>
bound. &nbsp;<i>See Bradshaw v. Richey,&nbsp;</i>546 U.S. 74,&nbsp;76 (2005) (“We have&nbsp;repeatedly held that a&nbsp;<br>
state court’s interpretation of state law, including one announced on&nbsp;direct appeal of the&nbsp;<br>
challenged conviction, binds a federal&nbsp;court sitting in habeas corpus.”);&nbsp;<i>see also</i>&nbsp;<i>Estelle v.&nbsp;</i><br>
<i>McGuire</i>, 502 U.S. 62,&nbsp;67-68 (1991) (“[I]t is not the&nbsp;province of a federal habeas court to&nbsp;<br>

judiciary.”).&nbsp;<br>
With this “triple deference” in mind,&nbsp;we turn to the issues raised.&nbsp;<br>
A.&nbsp;<br>
“In custody” requirement&nbsp;<br>
28 U.S.C. § 2254(a) provides:&nbsp;<br>
The Supreme Court, a Justice thereof, a&nbsp;circuit judge, or a district court&nbsp;<br>shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a&nbsp;<br>person&nbsp;<i>in&nbsp;custody</i>&nbsp;pursuant to the judgment of&nbsp;a State court only on the&nbsp;<br>ground that he is&nbsp;<i>in custody</i>&nbsp;in violation of the&nbsp;Constitution or laws or&nbsp;<br>treaties of the United States.&nbsp;<br>
(Emphasis added.) &nbsp;“The ‘in custody’ language of § 2254 is jurisdictional and requires&nbsp;<br>
habeas petitioners to be ‘in custody’ under the conviction or sentence under attack when&nbsp;<br>
they file the petition.” &nbsp;<i>Broomes v. Ashcroft</i>, 358 F.3d 1251, 1254 (10th Cir. 2004). &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Triplet filed his § 2254 petition attacking&nbsp;his attempted escape conviction on April&nbsp;<br>
6, 2006. &nbsp;At that time, he had already completed his two year sentence.8&nbsp; However, he&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
8&nbsp;In his pro se&nbsp;appellant brief, Triplet stated he was “no longer in custody on the&nbsp;<br>
challenged offense because [he]&nbsp;has already discharged&nbsp;that prison sentence” and referred&nbsp;<br>to “Doc. 4.” &nbsp;(Appellant’s Br. at 2.) &nbsp;Because&nbsp;that document appeared&nbsp;to indicate he had&nbsp;<br>completed his attempted escape sentence&nbsp;on December 22,&nbsp;2004, we requested&nbsp;<br>supplemental briefing from the parties as to&nbsp;whether Triplet was “in custody” on the&nbsp;<br>attempted escape charge at the time he filed his § 2254 petition. &nbsp;In the supplemental&nbsp;<br>briefs, neither Triplet (who was represented&nbsp;by appointed counsel) nor the State contested&nbsp;<br>the December 22, 2004 date as the date of&nbsp;discharge. &nbsp;However, in his supplemental&nbsp;<br>

<hr>
<A name=13></a>was still serving the eight years remaining on&nbsp;the sentences that were ordered to run&nbsp;<br>
concurrent with his attempted escape sentence&nbsp;(the concurrent series). &nbsp;Additionally, he&nbsp;<br>
had yet to serve the two concurrent ten-year&nbsp;sentences (eight years suspended)&nbsp;which&nbsp;<br>
were ordered to run consecutive to the concurrent series. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;hyperlink, n.8. &nbsp;The fact the&nbsp;<br>
attempted escape sentence was part of a consecutive series, with sentences remaining to&nbsp;<br>
be served within&nbsp;the consecutive series at the time he&nbsp;filed his § 2254 petition, is critical.&nbsp;<br>
In&nbsp;<i>Peyton v. Rowe</i>, two state prisoners serving consecutive sentences filed federal&nbsp;<br>
habeas petitions attacking convictions whose&nbsp;sentences were set to run second in the&nbsp;<br>
consecutive series,&nbsp;<i>i.e.</i>, convictions whose sentences they&nbsp;were not yet serving.&nbsp; 391 U.S.&nbsp;<br>
54, 55-57 (1968). &nbsp;Nevertheless, the Supreme&nbsp;Court determined they were “in custody”&nbsp;<br>
on the second convictions for purposes of federal habeas&nbsp;relief. &nbsp;It held that when a&nbsp;<br>
habeas petitioner is in custody under consecutive state sentences, those sentences should&nbsp;<br>
be considered in the aggregate&nbsp;or as&nbsp;a continuous series. &nbsp;<i>Id</i>. at 64-65. &nbsp;It reasoned that&nbsp;<br>
one of the purposes of the habeas corpus writ&nbsp;is to provide “swift judicial review of&nbsp;<br>
alleged unlawful restraints on liberty” and it&nbsp;is in both the government and defendant’s&nbsp;<br>
interests to have the claims&nbsp;determined before the lapse of time prejudices the truth-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>filings, Triplet referred to a document indicating Triplet’s reception date into the ODOC&nbsp;<br>was December 22, 2004. &nbsp;Therefore, it is&nbsp;impossible for him to have completed his&nbsp;<br>sentence on that date. &nbsp;Moreover, performing an offender&nbsp;search on the ODOC’s website,&nbsp;<br>of which we&nbsp;take judicial notice,&nbsp;<i>see</i>&nbsp;Fed. R. Evid. 201, has&nbsp;revealed Triplet began his&nbsp;<br>attempted escape sentence on December 22,&nbsp;2004, and completed it on May 7, 2005. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;<br>http://docapp065p.doc.state.ok.us/servlet/page?_pageid=394&amp;_dad=portal30&amp;_schema=PORTA<br>L30&amp;doc_num=489669&amp;offender_book_id=286523. &nbsp;These dates are more logical, given&nbsp;<br>that Triplet did not enter his guilty plea until May 19, 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, Triplet had&nbsp;<br>already served his attempted escape sentence at the time he filed his § 2254 petition.&nbsp;<br>
- 13 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=14></a>finding process. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 59-64. &nbsp;Therefore, a prisoner&nbsp;serving consecutive sentences should&nbsp;<br>
not have to wait to challenge&nbsp;a sentence until he is actually&nbsp;serving it. Consequently, the&nbsp;<br>
Court determined the prisoners were considered “in custody” on the&nbsp;second sentence&nbsp;<br>
while they were serving the first sentence in the consecutive series. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 67.&nbsp;<br>
<i>Peyton’s</i>&nbsp;holding was extended in&nbsp;<i>Garlotte v. Fordice</i>, 515 U.S. 39 (1995). &nbsp;There,&nbsp;<br>
a state prisoner serving consecutive sentences filed a § 2254 petition challenging the&nbsp;<br>
conviction whose sentence had&nbsp;already run. &nbsp;Relying on&nbsp;<i>Peyton</i>, specifically the fact that&nbsp;<br>
consecutive sentences are considered a continuous series, the Supreme Court held the&nbsp;<br>
prisoner was “in custody” for purposes of federal habeas relief. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;at 41. &nbsp;A petitioner&nbsp;<br>
incarcerated under consecutive sentences “remains ‘in custody’&nbsp;under all of his sentences&nbsp;<br>
until all are served.”9&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Id.</i>;&nbsp;<i>see also Foster v. Booher</i>, 296 F.3d 947, 949-50 (10th Cir.&nbsp;<br>
2002) (concluding petitioner was “in custody”&nbsp;under § 2254 even though he had served&nbsp;<br>
the sentence on the challenged conviction because that sentence ran consecutive to&nbsp;<br>
sentences which had not yet been served). &nbsp;<br>
The continuing series rationale of&nbsp;<i>Garlotte</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Foster</i>&nbsp;controls here. &nbsp;Because&nbsp;<br>
Triplet’s attempted escape sentence was part&nbsp;of a consecutive series, he remained “in&nbsp;<br>
custody” on that sentence for purposes of federal habeas relief until all of the sentences in&nbsp;<br>
the consecutive series were served. &nbsp;At the time he filed&nbsp;his&nbsp;habeas petition, he had yet to&nbsp;<br>
serve the two concurrent ten-year&nbsp;(eight&nbsp;years suspended) sentences ordered to run&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
9&nbsp;There was no need for the&nbsp;Court to carve out a similar rule for concurrent&nbsp;<br>
sentences. &nbsp;Because they run simultaneously, a defendant sentenced to concurrent&nbsp;<br>sentences naturally remains “in&nbsp;custody” until all are served.&nbsp;<br>
- 14 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=15></a>consecutive&nbsp;to the concurrent series containing the attempted escape sentence. &nbsp;<br>
Consequently, Triplet was “in custody” on the attempted escape conviction when he filed&nbsp;<br>
his petition even though he had already served&nbsp;the sentence. &nbsp;The State does not contend&nbsp;<br>
otherwise.&nbsp;<br>
B.&nbsp;<br>
Justiciability&nbsp;<br>
Federal habeas corpus relief under&nbsp;§ 2254&nbsp;does not lie to correct mere errors of&nbsp;<br>
state law. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;28 U.S.C. § 2254 (“The Supreme Court,&nbsp;a Justice thereof,&nbsp;a circuit judge,&nbsp;<br>
or a district court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a&nbsp;<br>
person in&nbsp;custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court&nbsp;<i>only on the ground that he is&nbsp;</i><br>
<i>in custody in violation of&nbsp;the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.</i>”)&nbsp;<br>
(emphasis added);&nbsp;<i>Estelle</i>, 502 U.S. at 67. &nbsp;“[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas&nbsp;<br>
court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions. &nbsp;In conducting&nbsp;<br>
habeas review [of persons in state custody],&nbsp;a federal court is limited to deciding whether&nbsp;<br>
a conviction violated the Constitution, laws, or treaties of&nbsp;the United States.” &nbsp;<i>Estelle</i>, 502&nbsp;<br>
U.S. at 67-68.&nbsp;<br>
Triplet’s claim alleges a violation of&nbsp;the federal constitution, specifically, a&nbsp;<br>
criminal defendant’s Sixth and Fourteenth&nbsp;Amendment right to effective assistance of&nbsp;<br>
counsel on a first appeal of right. &nbsp;<i>See Evitts v. Lucey</i>, 469 U.S. 387,&nbsp;392, 396 (1985). &nbsp;<br>
Oklahoma affords criminal defendants an appeal as a matter of right. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat.&nbsp;<br>
Ann. tit. 22, § 1051(a) (2004) (“An appeal to&nbsp;the Court of Criminal&nbsp;Appeals may be taken&nbsp;<br>
by the defendant, as a matter of right from&nbsp;any judgment against him . . . .”). &nbsp;Triplet’s&nbsp;<br>
claim&nbsp;is cognizable under § 2254.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
- 15 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=16></a>C.&nbsp;<br>
Effect of Guilty Plea&nbsp;<br>
Triplet pled guilty to the attempted escape charge. &nbsp;A voluntary guilty plea waives&nbsp;<br>
all non-jurisdictional defects. &nbsp;<i>See Berget v. State</i>, 824 P.2d 364, 372&nbsp;(Okla. Crim. App.&nbsp;<br>
1991). &nbsp;But&nbsp;Triplet alleges his guilty plea (even though entered as an adult) could not&nbsp;<br>
waive a jurisdictional defect—without adult certification, the adult court lacked&nbsp;<br>
jurisdiction over the attempted escape charge,&nbsp;which he was charged with when&nbsp;he was a&nbsp;<br>
juvenile. &nbsp;So, according to Triplet, his claim that appellate counsel was ineffective for&nbsp;<br>
failing to raise the jurisdictional defect also survives.10&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
We agree Triplet’s guilty plea did not waive his ineffective assistance claim but&nbsp;<br>
for a different reason. &nbsp;A guilty plea&nbsp;only waives claims “that occurred&nbsp;<i>prior to</i>&nbsp;the entry&nbsp;<br>
of the guilty plea.” &nbsp;<i>Tollett v. Henderson</i>, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973) (emphasis&nbsp;added);&nbsp;<i>see</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>also Berget</i>, 824 P.2d at 372 (“[A]&nbsp;guilty plea waives all&nbsp;<i>previous</i>&nbsp;non-jurisdictional&nbsp;<br>
defects . . . .”) (emphasis added). &nbsp;Triplet’s&nbsp;ineffective assistance&nbsp;of appellate counsel&nbsp;<br>
claim did not arise until after his plea. &nbsp;Therefore, it was not waived&nbsp;by the plea. &nbsp;But that&nbsp;<br>
is not the end of the inquiry.&nbsp;<br>
Triplet’s guilty plea to the attempted escape&nbsp;charge is significant in a different&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
10&nbsp;In his pro se&nbsp;brief, Triplet makes a conclusory and perfunctory&nbsp;claim&nbsp;that his&nbsp;<br>
guilty plea was forced and therefore involuntary. &nbsp;Appointed counsel makes no&nbsp;such&nbsp;<br>argument in the supplemental brief. &nbsp;Because&nbsp;Triplet has not explained how his plea was&nbsp;<br>forced or presented any argument on the issue, we will not address it. &nbsp;<i>See United States&nbsp;<br>v. Wooten</i>, 377 F.3d 1134, 1145&nbsp;(10th Cir. 2004) (“The court will not consider . . . issues&nbsp;<br>adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some&nbsp;effort at developed&nbsp;<br>argumentation.”) (quotations omitted). &nbsp;In any event, this&nbsp;argument was denied by the&nbsp;<br>state trial court after a hearing and the OCCA&nbsp;affirmed. &nbsp;We defer to the state courts and&nbsp;<br>indeed see no basis for disagreement.&nbsp;<br>
- 16 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=17></a>regard. &nbsp;Appellate counsel cannot be considered ineffective for failing to raise a claim on&nbsp;<br>
direct appeal that would&nbsp;have been deemed waived&nbsp;by Triplet’s guilty plea,&nbsp;<i>i.e.</i>, a non-<br>
jurisdictional claim. &nbsp;<i>See Leslie v. Abbott</i>, 117 Fed. Appx.&nbsp;72, 75-77 (10th Cir. 2004)&nbsp;<br>
(unpublished);&nbsp;<i>see also United States v. Simmons</i>, 142 F.3d 1279, No. 97-40678, 1998&nbsp;<br>
WL 224564, at *3 (5th Cir.&nbsp;Apr. 21, 1998) (unpublished).11&nbsp; Indeed, in Oklahoma, an&nbsp;<br>
appeal from a conviction upon a plea of guilty&nbsp;(a certiorari appeal) “is limited to two&nbsp;<br>
inquiries: (1) whether the guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily; and (2)&nbsp;<br>
whether the district court accepting the guilty plea had jurisdiction to accept the plea.” &nbsp;<br>
<i>Cox v. State</i>, 152 P.3d 244, 247 (Okla. Crim. App. 2006);&nbsp;<i>see also</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit.&nbsp;<br>
22, § 1051(a), (c) &nbsp;(2004) (stating “[t]he scope of review&nbsp;to be&nbsp;afforded on certiorari shall&nbsp;<br>
be prescribed by the Court of Criminal Appeals”). &nbsp;In other words, absent a claim the plea&nbsp;<br>
was not knowingly or voluntarily&nbsp;made (a claim appellate counsel raised and the OCCA&nbsp;<br>
rejected in this case), a certiorari appeal is&nbsp;limited to whether the court accepting the plea&nbsp;<br>
had jurisdiction. &nbsp;Consequently, if the lack&nbsp;of adult certification did not deprive the&nbsp;<br>
district court of jurisdiction, appellate counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to&nbsp;<br>
raise it as such a claim would have been waived by Triplet’s guilty plea and would&nbsp;have&nbsp;<br>
been outside the scope of the OCCA’s review.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although a merits issue, we&nbsp;<br>
consider here whether the lack of&nbsp;adult certification is jurisdictional.&nbsp;<br>
Two claims were before the OCCA: (1) Triplet’s attempted escape conviction was&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
11&nbsp;Unpublished opinions&nbsp;are not binding precedent. &nbsp;10th Cir. R. App. P. 32.1(A). &nbsp;<br>
We mention&nbsp;<i>Leslie</i>,&nbsp;<i>Simmons&nbsp;</i>and the other unpublished cases&nbsp;cited in this opinion as we&nbsp;<br>would any other non-precedential authority.&nbsp;<br>
- 17 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=18></a>void and his due process rights violated because he was seventeen at&nbsp;the time he was&nbsp;<br>
charged with the offense and was never certified&nbsp;to be tried as an adult, and (2) appellate&nbsp;<br>
counsel was ineffective for failing to raise&nbsp;this issue on direct appeal. &nbsp;The OCCA&nbsp;<br>
concluded all claims&nbsp;which could have been but were not raised on direct appeal were&nbsp;<br>
waived and appellate counsel was not ineffective. &nbsp;Obviously, the waiver ruling pertained&nbsp;<br>
to Triplet’s first claim as his second claim could&nbsp;not have been raised on direct appeal. &nbsp;In&nbsp;<br>
Oklahoma, issues of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and can be raised for&nbsp;<br>
the first time on collateral review. &nbsp;<i>See Wallace&nbsp;v. Oklahoma</i>, 935 P.2d 366, 372 (Okla.&nbsp;<br>
Crim. App. 1997) (“[E]ven though not raised on direct appeal, issues of subject matter&nbsp;<br>
jurisdiction are never waived and can therefore be raised on a collateral appeal.”). &nbsp;Thus,&nbsp;<br>
the OCCA evidently did not&nbsp;consider Triplet’s first claim jurisdictional because it&nbsp;<br>
deemed it waived. &nbsp;We are bound by&nbsp;this state law determination. &nbsp;<i>See Bradshaw,&nbsp;</i>546&nbsp;<br>
U.S. at 76;&nbsp;<i>Estelle</i>, 502 U.S. at 67-68;&nbsp;<i>Chandler</i>, 940 F.2d at 366;&nbsp;<i>Wills</i>, 532 F.2d at&nbsp;<br>
1059. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The OCCA&nbsp;did not explain its conclusion&nbsp;but our own review of Oklahoma&nbsp;law&nbsp;<br>
convinces us it is correct. &nbsp;Triplet was tried and sentenced as&nbsp;a youthful offender in the&nbsp;<br>
robbery case. &nbsp;Therefore, as stated previously, he should&nbsp;have been treated as a youthful&nbsp;<br>
offender, not as an adult, in&nbsp;the attempted escape case. &nbsp;But,&nbsp;even&nbsp;had he been&nbsp;properly&nbsp;<br>
treated as a youthful offender, his prosecution and sentencing would have proceeded&nbsp;<br>
before the district court (adult court). &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit.&nbsp;10, § 7306-2.4(A)-(C),&nbsp;<br>
7306-2.9(A), (B). &nbsp;Therefore, whether treated as&nbsp;a youthful offender or as an adult, the&nbsp;<br>
district court clearly had the authority, and&nbsp;jurisdiction, to accept Triplet’s plea and&nbsp;<br>
- 18 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=19></a>sentence him in the attempted escape case. &nbsp;<i>See Puckett v. Cook</i>, 586 P.2d 721,&nbsp;723&nbsp;<br>
(Okla. 1978) (“Jurisdiction includes power to hear and decide a justiciable&nbsp;<br>
controversy.”);&nbsp;<i>Welch v. Focht</i>, 171 P. 730, 733 (Okla. 1918) (“Jurisdiction is the power&nbsp;<br>
to hear and determine the subject-matter in&nbsp;controversy between parties to a&nbsp;suit, to&nbsp;<br>
adjudicate or exercise any judicial power over&nbsp;them . . . . &nbsp;If the law confers the power to&nbsp;<br>
render a judgment or decree, then the court&nbsp;has jurisdiction.”) (quotations omitted). &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The only error in this case occurred when the district court sentenced Triplet to the&nbsp;<br>
ODOC. &nbsp;In general, a district court sentences a youthful offender to the custody or&nbsp;<br>
supervision of the Office of Juvenile Affairs. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit.&nbsp;10, § 7306-2.9(B). &nbsp;<br>
A district court may, however, sentence a youthful offender to the custody or supervision&nbsp;<br>
of the ODOC if it certifies the juvenile to receive an adult sentence. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7306-2.8(B). &nbsp;<br>
The State initiates the certification process by filing a motion for certification. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§&nbsp;<br>
7306-2.8(A). &nbsp;The court then orders an investigation (unless waived by the juvenile) and&nbsp;<br>
holds a hearing, at which it considers,&nbsp;<i>inter alia</i>, the nature of the alleged offense, the&nbsp;<br>
juvenile’s sophistication and maturity, his previous record, the likelihood of reasonable&nbsp;<br>
rehabilitation of the youthful offender in the juvenile system&nbsp;if he is found to have&nbsp;<br>
committed the offense and whether the offense occurred while the person was escaping&nbsp;<br>
from a secure facility. &nbsp;<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7306-2.8(C). &nbsp;If, after the hearing, the court determines there&nbsp;<br>
is good cause to believe the juvenile would not reasonably complete a plan of&nbsp;<br>
rehabilitation or the public would not be adequately protected if the juvenile was&nbsp;<br>
sentenced as&nbsp;a youthful&nbsp;offender, it may certify the juvenile to receive an adult sentence. &nbsp;<br>
<i>Id.</i>&nbsp;§ 7306-2.8(D). &nbsp;The certification must occur prior to the juvenile pleading guilty so&nbsp;he&nbsp;<br>
- 19 -&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=20></a>will know the range of punishment&nbsp;he is facing&nbsp;by pleading guilty. &nbsp;<i>See A.J.B. v. State</i>,&nbsp;<br>
992 P.2d 911, 912-13 (Okla.&nbsp;Crim. App. 1999) (interpreting § 7306-2.8(A) as requiring&nbsp;<br>
completion of the proceedings&nbsp;on the State’s motion for adult&nbsp;sentencing before a guilty&nbsp;<br>
plea is entered or accepted so juvenile will know range of punishment he is facing if plea&nbsp;<br>
entered).&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>If the court certifies the juvenile to receive&nbsp;an adult sentence, it shall, “upon . . .&nbsp;<br>
the entry of a plea of guilty . . . , impose sentence as provided by&nbsp;law for an adult for&nbsp;<br>
punishment of the offense committed.” &nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 10,&nbsp;§ 7306-2.8(E). &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
In this case, the district court sentenced Triplet to the ODOC without first&nbsp;<br>
certifying him to receive such sentence prior to his guilty plea. &nbsp;But that failure did not&nbsp;<br>
divest the district court of subject matter jurisdiction, which it acquired upon the filing of&nbsp;<br>
the criminal information. &nbsp;<i>See M.K.H. v. State</i>, 946 P.2d 677, 679 (Okla. Crim. App.&nbsp;<br>
1997) (“[A] trial court’s jurisdiction is triggered by the filing of an Information alleging&nbsp;<br>
the commission of a public offense with appropriate venue. &nbsp;And the general rule&nbsp;is that&nbsp;<br>
once the District Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and the person, it will not be&nbsp;<br>

<i>Turk v. Corywell</i>, 419 P.2d 555, 558 (Okla. 1966) (“The general rule&nbsp;is that when&nbsp;<br>
jurisdiction of the subject matter and the person is once acquired it will not be defeated or&nbsp;<br>
divested by subsequent&nbsp;events.”);&nbsp;<i>c.f. Mason v. State</i>, 868 P.2d 724,&nbsp;726-27 (Okla. Crim.&nbsp;<br>
App. 1994)&nbsp;(once the district court acquired adult jurisdiction over a juvenile due to his&nbsp;<br>
having been&nbsp;charged with a crime requiring him&nbsp;to&nbsp;be tried as an adult, the court retained&nbsp;<br>
jurisdiction to convict and sentence the juvenile for any lesser included offense, even a&nbsp;<br>
non-enumerated offense). &nbsp;Indeed, the Oklahoma&nbsp;district courts are courts of general&nbsp;<br>

<hr>
<A name=21></a>jurisdiction constitutionally endowed with unlimited original jurisdiction of all justiciable&nbsp;<br>
matters. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;OKLA. CONST. art. 7, §§ 7(a) (“The District Court shall have unlimited&nbsp;<br>
original jurisdiction of all justiciable matters,&nbsp;except as otherwise provided in&nbsp;this Article&nbsp;<br>
. . . .”), 7(b) (“All Courts in the State of Oklahoma . . . are hereby abolished . . . and their&nbsp;<br>
jurisdiction, functions, powers and duties are transferred to the respective District Courts&nbsp;<br>
. . . .”);&nbsp;<i>see&nbsp;also</i>&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 20, § 91.1 (“The district courts of the State of&nbsp;<br>
Oklahoma are the successors to&nbsp;the jurisdiction of all other&nbsp;courts, including the . . .&nbsp;<br>
Juvenile Courts . . . .”). &nbsp;The error in this&nbsp;case was more appropriately one of due process&nbsp;<br>
(<i>i.e.</i>, a non-jurisdictional violation). &nbsp;But Triplet waived any due&nbsp;process claim&nbsp;by&nbsp;<br>
pleading guilty. &nbsp;<i>See Berget,&nbsp;</i>824 P.2d at 372;&nbsp;<i>United States v. Wright,&nbsp;</i>43 F.3d 491, 494&nbsp;<br>
(10th Cir. 1994);&nbsp;<i>United States v. Trevizo-Miramontes</i>, 20 Fed. Appx. 823, 825 (10th Cir.&nbsp;<br>
2001) (unpublished). &nbsp;And, in&nbsp;any event, certiorari appeal is not available in Oklahoma&nbsp;<br>
for such non-jurisdictional claims. &nbsp;Therefore,&nbsp;appellate counsel was not ineffective for&nbsp;<br>
failing to raise the issue.12&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
12&nbsp;We acknowledge the OCCA&nbsp;has held the district court (adult court) cannot&nbsp;<br>
obtain jurisdiction to&nbsp;try a juvenile as an&nbsp;adult absent a certification proceeding. &nbsp;<i>See, e.g.,&nbsp;<br>Edwards v. Oklahoma</i>,&nbsp;591 P.2d 313, 319 (Okla. Crim. App. 1979)&nbsp;(“The district court&nbsp;<br>could not obtain jurisdiction to try a juvenile as an adult without a certification&nbsp;<br>proceeding.”);&nbsp;<i>see also&nbsp;Bishop v. Oklahoma</i>, 595 P.2d 795, 796 (Okla. Crim. App. 1979)&nbsp;<br>(holding juvenile could not waive&nbsp;the juvenile court’s jurisdiction by confessing to a&nbsp;<br>motion to certify);<i>&nbsp;Ex Parte Dickerson</i>, 94 P.2d 951, 954 (Okla. Crim. App. 1939) (“[a]s&nbsp;<br>to all juvenile offenses, the district court is&nbsp;a court of limited or special jurisdiction, and&nbsp;<br>not a court of general jurisdiction”; without&nbsp;a certificate from the juvenile court showing&nbsp;<br>the juvenile competent to know the&nbsp;wrongfulness of his acts and probable cause&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>believe he committed the crime,&nbsp;the district court was without jurisdiction over the&nbsp;<br>juvenile’s prosecution). &nbsp;We question the&nbsp;continued viability the use of the word&nbsp;<br>“jurisdiction” in these cases given the general jurisdiction of Oklahoma’s district courts&nbsp;<br>and the fact that when&nbsp;Oklahoma abolished its&nbsp;juvenile courts in 1968, it transferred their&nbsp;<br>

<A name=22></a>Even assuming,&nbsp;<i>arguendo</i>, the issue is a jurisdictional (non-waivable) issue under&nbsp;<br>
Oklahoma law, appellate counsel was only ineffective under federal law&nbsp;if (1) the lack of&nbsp;<br>
adult certification issue was plainly meritorious or (2) the issue was not plainly&nbsp;<br>
meritorious but nevertheless should have been&nbsp;raised when&nbsp;assessed&nbsp;against the other&nbsp;<br>
potential issues to be raised. &nbsp;<i>See Cargle</i>, 317 F.3d at 1202;&nbsp;<i>see also Smith v. Robbins</i>,&nbsp;<br>
528 U.S. 259, 285, 288 (2000). &nbsp;However, whether the lack&nbsp;of adult certification issue&nbsp;<br>
had merit is plainly one&nbsp;of Oklahoma&nbsp;law. &nbsp;Again, “it is not the province of a federal&nbsp;<br>
habeas court to reexamine state court determinations on state-law questions.” &nbsp;<i>Estelle</i>,&nbsp;<br>
502 U.S. at 67-68. &nbsp;In this case, the OCCA&nbsp;did not explain why it rejected Triplet’s&nbsp;<br>
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim. &nbsp;But implicitly, the OCCA must have&nbsp;<br>
concluded the lack of adult certification issue was meritless or had merit but was not so&nbsp;<br>
compelling in light of the rest of the appeal. &nbsp;We will not, and cannot, second-guess this&nbsp;<br>
determination of Oklahoma law. &nbsp;Deferring to&nbsp;this determination and applying the double&nbsp;<br>
deference accorded an&nbsp;ineffective assistance of counsel&nbsp;claim evaluated under the §&nbsp;<br>
2254(d)(1),&nbsp;<i>see Knowles</i>, 129 S. Ct. at 1420,&nbsp;we cannot say the OCCA’s conclusion that&nbsp;<br>
Triplet’s appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the lack of adult&nbsp;<br>
certification issue was an unreasonable application of&nbsp;<i>Strickland</i>. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>jurisdiction to the district courts. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;OKLA.&nbsp;CONST. art. 7, §§ 7(a), 7(b); Okla. Stat.&nbsp;<br>Ann. tit. 20, § 91.1. &nbsp;In any event, we need&nbsp;not resolve the issue.&nbsp; These cases occurred&nbsp;<br>prior to Oklahoma enacting its Youthful Offender Act on January 1,&nbsp;1998. &nbsp;Prior to the&nbsp;<br>Act, a juvenile would be tried as&nbsp;a child in the juvenile division of the district court unless&nbsp;<br>certified to be tried as an adult or statutorily&nbsp;required to&nbsp;be tried as an adult due to his age&nbsp;<br>and the nature of his offense. &nbsp;Under the Act, a juvenile can be held&nbsp;accountable as a&nbsp;<br>child, youthful offender or adult. &nbsp;If treated as a youthful&nbsp;offender, the juvenile, like an&nbsp;<br>adult, is tried and sentenced by&nbsp;the district court (adult court).&nbsp;<br>
