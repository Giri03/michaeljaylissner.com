<b>OPINION</b><br>
CALLAHAN, Circuit Judge:<br>
Plaintiffs brought this action under 42 U.S.C. §&nbsp;1983<br>
against the Los Angeles County Sheriff, Leroy Baca (“Baca”),<br>in his official capacity. Plaintiffs allege that their civil rights<br>were violated when they were kept in custody by the Los<br>Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (“LASD”) for periods<br>of time ranging from twenty-six to twenty-nine hours after the<br>court had authorized their releases, and that their over-<br>detentions were the result of a policy of deliberate indiffer-<br>ence to their constitutional rights. We determine that our prior<br>opinion in this litigation,&nbsp;<i>Berry v. Baca</i>, 379 F.3d 764 (9th<br>Cir. 2004), did not preclude the district court from consider-<br>ing defendant’s motion for summary judgment on its merits,<br>and that the court properly granted defendant’s motion for<br>summary judgment because the proffered evidence would not<br>support a finding of deliberate indifference.<br>
I<br>
As noted in our prior opinion, plaintiff Roger Mortimer was<br>
acquitted at 11:45 a.m. on August 14, 2000, the Superior<br>Court authorized his release, and he was released on August<br>15, 2000 at 4:57 p.m.&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>, 379 F.3d at 767. The Superior<br>
<hr>
<A name=3></a>MORTIMER&nbsp;v. BACA<br>
2087<br>
Court ordered plaintiff Anthony Hart’s release from jail on<br>August 17, 2000, and he was released on August 18, 2000, at<br>2:02 p.m., just over twenty-nine hours after the court autho-<br>rized his release.&nbsp;<i>Id</i>. The Superior Court authorized the<br>release of plaintiff Rodney Berry on February 1, 2001 at<br>11:30 a.m., and he was released on February 2, 2001, at 2:02<br>p.m.&nbsp;<i>Id</i>. Plaintiff S.A. Thomas was held in the Los Angeles<br>County Jail until June 23, 2004, but claims that he should<br>have been released two days earlier on June 21, 2004. Plain-<br>tiffs filed their actions in the United States District Court for<br>the Central District of California alleging&nbsp;“a policy of deliber-<br>ate indifference to their constitutional rights that resulted in<br>unlawful periods of over-detention.”&nbsp;<i>Id</i>. at 766. Their cases<br>were consolidated before the district court.&nbsp;<i>Id</i>.<br>
A.&nbsp;<i>Berry v. Baca, 370 F.3d 764</i>.<br>
On May 29, 2003, the district court granted Baca’s motion<br>
for summary judgment based on the Ninth Circuit’s decision<br>in&nbsp;<i>Brass v. County of Los Angeles</i>, 328 F.3d 1192 (9th Cir.<br>2003). Plaintiffs appealed and we reversed and remanded.&nbsp;<i>Id</i>.<br>at 773. We first set forth the applicable law and explained the<br>district court’s ruling as follows:<br>
In order to hold Baca liable under §&nbsp;1983, plaintiffs<br>must demonstrate that&nbsp;“&nbsp;‘action pursuant to official<br>municipal policy of some nature caused a constitu-<br>tional tort.’&nbsp;”&nbsp;<i>Brass,</i>&nbsp;328 F.3d at 1198 (quoting<br><i>Monell,</i>&nbsp;436 U.S. at 691 . . .). We have stated that&nbsp;“a<br>local governmental body may be liable if it has a<br>policy of inaction and such inaction amounts to a<br>failure to protect constitutional rights.”&nbsp;<i>Oviatt v.<br>Pearce,</i>&nbsp;954 F.2d 1470, 1474 (9th Cir. 1992) (citing<br><i>City of Canton v. Harris,</i>&nbsp;489 U.S. 378, 388, . . .<br>(1989)). However, the policy of inaction must be<br>more than mere negligence,&nbsp;<i>see Daniels v. Williams,<br></i>474 U.S. 327, 333-36, . . . (1986); it must be a con-<br>scious or deliberate choice among various alterna-<br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a>2088<br>
MORTIMER&nbsp;v. BACA<br>
tives.&nbsp;<i>See Lee v. City of Los Angeles,</i>&nbsp;250 F.3d 668,<br>681 (9th Cir.2001).<br>
In order to impose liability based on a policy of<br>deliberate inaction, the&nbsp;“plaintiff must establish: (1)<br>that he possessed a constitutional right of which he<br>was deprived; (2) that the municipality had a policy;<br>(3) that this policy ‘amounts to deliberate indiffer-<br>ence’ to the plaintiff’s constitutional right; and (4)<br>that the policy [was] the ‘moving force behind the<br>constitutional violation.’&nbsp;”&nbsp;<i>Oviatt,</i>&nbsp;954 F.2d at 1474<br>(quoting&nbsp;<i>City of Canton,</i>&nbsp;489 U.S. at 389-91, . . . ).<br>
The district court did not discuss this four-step show-<br>ing, because it did not address the plaintiffs’ claims<br>that the County’s policies amount to a policy of<br>deliberate indifference to their constitutional rights.<br>Instead, the district court found that it&nbsp;“is bound by<br>the holding in&nbsp;<i>Brass</i>&nbsp;and finds that the County’s<br>challenged policies did not result in a violation of the<br>plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.”<br>
<i>Id</i>. at 767.<br>
We then found that&nbsp;<i>Brass&nbsp;</i>was distinguishable. We noted<br>
that&nbsp;“Brass’s primary claim focused on the County’s policy of<br>releasing prisoners pursuant to court order only after the com-<br>pletion of processing all inmates scheduled for release on that<br>day.”&nbsp;<i>Id</i>. at 768. We explained:<br>
Here, in contrast to&nbsp;<i>Brass,</i>&nbsp;the plaintiffs do not limit<br>their challenge to the County’s specific policies.<br>Rather, as argued in their briefs to this Court, they<br>challenge the policy&nbsp;“<i>in toto</i>&nbsp;. . . that simply delays<br>all releases until the system, in its sweet time, and<br>with the resources it chooses . . . is ready to make<br>releases.” Stated another way, the plaintiffs in this<br>case challenge the implementation of the County’s<br>
<hr>
<A name=5></a>MORTIMER&nbsp;v. BACA<br>
2089<br>
policies, rather than the specific policies themselves.<br>They claim that the County’s unreasonably ineffi-<br>cient implementation of its administrative policies<br>amounts to a policy of deliberate indifference to their<br>constitutional rights.<br>
While on first glance this may appear a subtle differ-<br>ence, in fact there is a crucial distinction between the<br>challenge to specific policies in&nbsp;<i>Brass</i>&nbsp;and the chal-<br>lenge to the implementation of the policy&nbsp;“in toto”<br>in this case. It cannot be the case that, if the Coun-<br>ty’s system of administratively processing releases<br>took several days or weeks to complete, its policy<br>could not be challenged as one of&nbsp;“deliberate indif-<br>ference” simply because each of the administrative<br>procedures employed is theoretically reasonable. As<br>a matter of law, the County’s system of administra-<br>tive processing cannot be immune from allegations<br>that, in practice, it amounts to a policy of deliberate<br>indifference.&nbsp;<i>Brass</i>&nbsp;did not raise this type of chal-<br>lenge, because Brass focused his challenge upon the<br>County’s release policies themselves. Tellingly,<br>nowhere in the&nbsp;<i>Brass</i>&nbsp;opinion does the panel discuss<br>the&nbsp;“deliberate indifference” line of&nbsp;<i>Monell</i>&nbsp;cases,<br>because this was not the claim at issue. Here, in con-<br>trast, deliberate indifference is precisely the claim at<br>issue.<br>
<i>Id</i>. at 768.<br>
We then found the case to be more closely related to&nbsp;<i>Oviatt</i><br>
<i>v. Pearce</i>, 954 F.2d 1470, where the plaintiff alleged that he<br>had been held without arraignment for 114 days because the<br>county’s&nbsp;“policy regarding missed arraignments constituted a<br>policy of deliberate indifference to the inmates’ constitutional<br>rights.”&nbsp;<i>Berry,</i>&nbsp;379 F.3d at 768-69. The panel noted that&nbsp;<i>Berry<br></i>concerned only 29 hours of over-detention rather than 114<br>days, and that the defendants had offered&nbsp;“more substantial<br>
<hr>
<A name=6></a>2090<br>
MORTIMER&nbsp;v. BACA<br>
justifications for its delay,” but concluded that at the summary<br>judgment stage the&nbsp;<i>Oviatt</i>&nbsp;framework applied.&nbsp;<i>Id</i>. at 769.<br>
A the end of the opinion, the panel returned to&nbsp;“<i>Oviatt</i>’s<br>
four-step framework for resolving&nbsp;<i>Monell</i>&nbsp;claims of deliberate<br>indifference.”&nbsp;<i>Id.&nbsp;</i>at 773. The court commented:<br>
In order to impose liability based on a policy of<br>deliberate inaction, the plaintiff must establish that<br>he possessed a constitutional right of which he was<br>deprived. Here, the plaintiffs possessed a constitu-<br>tional right to freedom from imprisonment a reason-<br>able time after they were judicially determined to be<br>innocent of the charges against them.&nbsp;<i>See Oviatt,</i>&nbsp;954<br>F.2d at 1474 (stating that&nbsp;“[t]he Supreme Court has<br>recognized that an individual has a liberty interest in<br>being free from incarceration absent a criminal con-<br>viction”);&nbsp;<i>cf. Brass,</i>&nbsp;328 F.3d at 1200 (recognizing<br>that the plaintiff&nbsp;“may have had a due process right<br>to be released within a reasonable time after the rea-<br>son for his detention ended”).<br>
Step two of&nbsp;<i>Oviatt</i>&nbsp;— the existence of a municipal<br>policy — is uncontested. Both parties agree that the<br>County has a set of administrative policies that guide<br>releases after judicial determinations of innocence.<br>Both parties also agree on step four: these policies<br>resulted in delays in the release of each of the plain-<br>tiffs, ranging from twenty-six to twenty-nine hours<br>after their court-ordered release.<br>
Step three of&nbsp;<i>Oviatt</i>&nbsp;remains: did this set of policies<br>— or, alternatively, the lack of policies to expedite<br>the process — amount to a policy of deliberate indif-<br>ference to the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights? This<br>question turns on whether the County’s implementa-<br>tion of its policies was reasonable in light of the<br>delay that resulted. Baca concedes that he knew that<br>
<hr>
<A name=7></a>MORTIMER&nbsp;v. BACA<br>
2091<br>
the implementation of the County’s policies was<br>resulting in delays of up to 48 hours. Therefore, if<br>the delays were not reasonably justified, the §&nbsp;1983<br>claim against the County has merit, because the<br>County was continuing to adhere to a policy that it<br>knew resulted in unlawful detentions without reason-<br>able cause.&nbsp;<i>See Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Brown,<br></i>520 U.S. 397, 407, . . . (1997) We find that this ques-<br>tion of reasonableness is properly conceived of as a<br>jury determination.<br>
<i>Id</i>.<br>
B.&nbsp;<i>Proceedings on remand.</i><br>
On remand both sides submitted evidence in the form of<br>
exhibits and declarations. The district court found that defen-<br>dant’s evidence showed that the number of over-detentions<br>had been substantially reduced. The total number of over-<br>detentions of inmates in the County system of 24 hours or<br>more peaked in 1997, and declined every subsequent year<br>through 2004. Specifically, the defendant offered evidence<br>that the numbers declined from 248 over-detentions in 1997<br>to 9 in 2004. During the time period in issue, there were<br>50,706 inmate releases with only 43 over-detentions of 24<br>hours or more.<br>
The defendant presented evidence that the LASD had insti-<br>
tuted several measures to reduce the number of over-<br>detentions. These included the&nbsp;“In-Court Release” program,<br>which began in 2001. This program allows inmates to be<br>released at the courthouse immediately following a judge’s<br>release order without returning to the jail, provided that a<br>prompt check of the database does not reveal any other war-<br>rants or holds. Another measure was the&nbsp;“Greenband” pro-<br>gram in which inmates who could not be released at the<br>courthouse due to a need to give a DNA sample or have a<br>medical examination were given a green wristband and<br>
<hr>
<A name=8></a>2092<br>
MORTIMER&nbsp;v. BACA<br>
returned to the Inmate Reception Center (“IRC”) only briefly<br>to perform the procedure before release. A third measure was<br>the Early Release Program, which begins the process for<br>releasing inmates 72 hours before the expiration of their sen-<br>tences, and often resulted in their early release.<br>
In addition, Baca proffered evidence that the LASD had<br>
created a database called the&nbsp;“Over-Detention and Erroneous<br>Release” tracking system (“ODER”) to keep track of recorded<br>potential over-detentions. The ODER system contains records<br>of all inmates held longer than 24 hours after their release is<br>entered into the Automated Justice Information System<br>(“AJIS”) database, although not all of these over-detentions<br>are deemed improper on further review. Defendant also<br>asserted that in order to reduce over-detentions, the LASD<br>had adopted a 26-week training program for new employees,<br>and that it tests on a daily basis the pneumatic system that<br>delivers documents related to inmates’ releases.<br>
Plaintiffs offered several items in opposition to Baca’s<br>
motion for summary judgment. First, they proffered the testi-<br>mony of Captain Charles Jackson, who headed the Inmate<br>Reception Center of the county jail from 1998 to 2000, that<br>during his tenure clerks at the IRC were given a day or two<br>to record potential over-detentions in their log book. Second,<br>they offered testimony from Patricia Bickley-Jones, a clerk at<br>the IRC, that she was required to keep a log book of over-<br>detentions, but that she never received instructions as to&nbsp;“what<br>the reason or reasons are, if any for listing when someone<br>might have been over-detained.” She indicated that she would<br>typically mark an inmate in the log book as a potential over-<br>detention if the inmate had been detained&nbsp;“a day over.” Plain-<br>tiffs also offered supervisor&nbsp;“packets” or reports for all over-<br>detentions from 2000 to 2005. The numbers of potential over-<br>detentions noted on these reports were higher than Baca’s<br>numbers although they also reflected the substantial decrease<br>of over-detentions to a total of 71 in 2005. Plaintiffs stressed<br>that very few of the recorded over-detentions were for a<br>
<hr>
<A name=9></a>MORTIMER&nbsp;v. BACA<br>
2093<br>
period of more than 24 hours, but less than 48 hours, and<br>asserted that this indicated that 24 to 48 hour over-detentions<br>were under-recorded.<br>
The district court granted Baca’s motion for summary judg-<br>
ment. It noted that even construing any ambiguities in plain-<br>tiffs’ favor,&nbsp;“plaintiffs’ own exhibit shows that the total<br>number of potential over-detentions listed in ODER and the<br>number of packets presented are very close.” It further noted<br>that the relatively low number of two day over-detentions was<br>logical in light of the In-Court Release and Greenband pro-<br>grams. These programs were in effect&nbsp;“as part of an injunc-<br>tion in&nbsp;<i>Vanke v. Block</i>&nbsp;(CV 98-4111).”<b>1</b>&nbsp;Thus, plaintiffs had<br>not provided the court&nbsp;“with sufficient ambiguity to cast<br>doubt on the Sheriff’s numbers.”<br>
The district court discounted the testimony of Captain Jack-<br>
son and Ms. Bickley-Jones. Capt. Jackson left his post as head<br>of IRC in April 2000; thus his understanding of the proce-<br>dures&nbsp;“is before the injunction in&nbsp;<i>Vanke</i>, before early release,<br>In-Court Release and Greenband programs, and before the<br>relevant class period.” The court noted that Ms. Bickley-<br>Jones’ deposition testimony was heavily excerpted in plain-<br>tiffs’ exhibit and concluded that it offered no indication that<br>there was a system of deliberate indifference.<br>
The district court explained its grant of summary judgment<br>
as follows:<br>
<b>1</b>In&nbsp;<i>Vanke</i>, the district court issued a preliminary injunction against the<br>
LASD in 1998 concerning practices that allegedly resulted in over-<br>detention of pre-trial detainees. In April 2001, the district court denied the<br>plaintiffs’ motion to convert the preliminary injunction into a permanent<br>injunction. The district court eventually awarded attorneys’ fees to plain-<br>tiffs’ attorney.&nbsp;<i>Vanke v. Block</i>, 2002 WL 1836305 (C.D. Cal. 2002). On<br>appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed the award of attorneys’ fees.&nbsp;<i>Vanke v.<br>Block</i>, 77 Fed. Appx. 948 (9th Cir. 2003).&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<A name=10></a>2094<br>
MORTIMER&nbsp;v. BACA<br>
&nbsp;The Court finds that the Sheriff has shown the<br>absence of a material issue of fact. The LASD pro-<br>cesses tens of thousands of detainees every year. For<br>the class period, nearly 51,000 individuals were<br>released. Each of these individuals has court-related<br>and administrative paperwork that must be processed<br>in order to ensure that the release was proper. Not<br>only has the Sheriff taken steps since&nbsp;<i>Vanke</i>&nbsp;to<br>reduce the number of potential overdetentions, the<br>number itself has dramatically decreased. As a mat-<br>ter of law, the Sheriff’s implementation of polic[ies]<br>since the&nbsp;<i>Vanke</i>&nbsp;injunction to effectuate 51,000<br>releases during the class period, of which 43 are<br>potential overdetentions, is reasonable and cannot<br>constitute a&nbsp;<i>Monell</i>&nbsp;deliberate indifference claim.<br>
Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal from the district<br>
court’s order granting summary judgment in favor of the<br>defendant.<br>
II<br>
This appeal raises two questions. First, whether our prior<br>
opinion in&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>&nbsp;required that the district court allow the case<br>proceed to a jury. Second, if our prior opinion did not fore-<br>close the district court’s consideration of the motion for sum-<br>mary judgment on its merits, whether the district court<br>properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defen-<br>dant.<br>
A.&nbsp;Berry<i>&nbsp;did not require that the district court allow</i><br>
<i>plaintiffs’ claims to be presented to a jury</i>.<br>
Although&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>&nbsp;concludes with the statement&nbsp;“[w]e find<br>
that this question of reasonableness is properly conceived of<br>as a jury determination,” both a careful review of the opinion<br>and an appreciation of Ninth Circuit precedent support a<br>
<hr>
<A name=11></a>MORTIMER&nbsp;v. BACA<br>
2095<br>
determination that the district court on remand properly con-<br>sidered Baca’s motion for summary judgment on its merits.<br>
In the context of the entire opinion, the&nbsp;“question” in the<br>
cited sentence appears to be whether the delays were unrea-<br>sonable (and hence violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights)<br>and not whether defendant had a policy of deliberate indiffer-<br>ence. Most importantly, in&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>&nbsp;we recognized that the dis-<br>trict court had not addressed&nbsp;“the plaintiffs’ claims that the<br>County’s policies amount to a policy of deliberate indiffer-<br>ence.”<b>2</b>&nbsp;379 F.3d at 767. Accordingly, the record before us in<br><i>Berry</i>&nbsp;was not sufficiently developed for us to determine as a<br>matter of law that there were material facts concerning the<br>alleged policy of deliberate indifference that precluded sum-<br>mary judgment.&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>’s focus on whether the delays might be<br>unreasonable, rather than whether the defendant had a policy<br>of deliberate indifference, is also reflected in other parts of the<br>opinion. For example, the panel comments that&nbsp;“[i]t may very<br>well be that a reasonable juror would conclude that, given the<br>necessary administrative tasks and voluminous demands on<br>the county, the delays at issue were justified,” and concludes<br>that&nbsp;“this is a factual determination that is appropriately left<br>to the jury to decide.”&nbsp;<i>Id</i>. at 771. Thus,&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>&nbsp;did not foreclose<br>the district court on remand from reviewing defendant’s prof-<br>fered evidence concerning deliberate indifference and ruling<br>on the motion for summary judgment on its merits.<br>
<b>[1]</b>&nbsp;The conclusion that the district court could consider the<br>
<b>2</b>The court’s specific comment was:&nbsp;<br>
The district court did not discuss [the&nbsp;<i>Oviatt</i>] four-step showing,<br>because it did not address the plaintiffs’ claims that the County’s<br>policies amount to a policy of deliberate indifference to their con-<br>stitutional rights. Instead, the district court found that it&nbsp;“is bound<br>by the holding in&nbsp;<i>Brass</i>&nbsp;and finds that the County’s challenged<br>policies did not result in a violation of the plaintiffs’ constitu-<br>tional rights.”&nbsp;<br>
379 F.3d at 767.&nbsp;<br>
<hr>

MORTIMER&nbsp;v. BACA<br>
motion for summary judgment on the merits is supported by<br>our interpretation of&nbsp;“law of the case.” Generally,&nbsp;“law of the<br>case” does not apply to issues or claims that were not actually<br>decided. 18 James Wm. Moore et al.,&nbsp;<i>Moore’s Federal Prac-<br>tice</i>&nbsp;¶&nbsp;134.20[4] (3d ed. 2009);&nbsp;<i>see United States ex rel. Lujan<br>v. Hughes Aircraft Co.</i>, 243 F.3d 1181, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001)<br>(“The doctrine does not apply to issues not addressed by the<br>appellate court.”);&nbsp;<i>Hegler v. Berg</i>, 50 F.3d 1472, 1475 (9th<br>Cir. 1995) (“The doctrine, however, applies only to issues<br>considered and actually decided by the first court.”).<br>
<b>[2]</b>&nbsp;Because we recognized in&nbsp;<i>Berry&nbsp;</i>that the district court<br>
had not addressed the evidence of deliberate indifference,<br>comments in the opinion concerning deliberate indifference<br>do not amount to an actual decision as to the sufficiency of<br>the evidence. To hold otherwise would be inequitable and<br>inefficient. Defendant would be prejudiced. Because the dis-<br>trict court did not address the evidence of deliberate indiffer-<br>ence, the defendant had no reason to present his facts and<br>arguments on this issue to the Ninth Circuit. Moreover, a con-<br>trary holding arguably would force a district court to allow the<br>issue to go to the jury even though the jury could not make<br>a factual finding in favor of the plaintiffs. If the jury made a<br>factually unsupported finding, the district judge would be<br>compelled to either direct a verdict on the issue or grant judg-<br>ment notwithstanding the verdict.<br>
<b>[3]</b>&nbsp;Finally, even if&nbsp;“law of the case” were otherwise con-<br>
strued to limit the district court’s options, we have recognized<br>an applicable exception. In&nbsp;<i>Minidoka Irrigation Dist. v. Dep’t<br>of Interior</i>, 406 F.3d 567 (9th Cir. 2005), we reiterated that<br>“the law of the case doctrine is subject to three exceptions that<br>may arise when&nbsp;“(1) the decision is clearly erroneous and its<br>enforcement would work a manifest injustice, (2) intervening<br>controlling authority makes reconsideration appropriate, or<br>(3) substantially different evidence was adduced at a subse-<br>quent trial.”&nbsp;<i>Id</i>. at 573 (citing&nbsp;<i>Old Person v. Brown,</i>&nbsp;312 F.3d<br>1036, 1039 (9th Cir. 2002)).&nbsp;<i>See also&nbsp;Hegler</i>, 50 F.3d at 1475<br>

(same);&nbsp;<i>Moore’s Federal Practice</i>&nbsp;¶&nbsp;134.22[2][b]. Here, even<br>though there was not a trial, the third exception applies and<br>allows the district court to consider the motion for summary<br>judgment on its merits. There was considerably more and dif-<br>ferent evidence before the district court in 2007, when it<br>granted the motion for summary judgment that is at issue in<br>this appeal, as compared to the record before the court in 2002<br>which was the record reviewed in&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>.<br>
We conclude that nothing in&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>&nbsp;precluded the district<br>
court from considering defendant’s new motion for summary<br>judgment on its merits because (1)&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>&nbsp;does not hold that<br>plaintiffs were entitled to have their allegations regarding a<br>policy of deliberate indifference determined by a jury, (2)<br>even if&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>&nbsp;is interpreted to contain such a suggestion, the<br>“law of the case” would not apply because the issue was not<br>actually determined by the panel, and (3) even if the&nbsp;“law of<br>the case” would otherwise apply, this case falls within the<br>exception to that doctrine for instances in which substantially<br>different evidence is adduced at the subsequent proceeding.<br>
B.&nbsp;<i>The district court properly granted summary judgment</i>.<br>
The district court’s grant of summary judgment is reviewed<br>
de novo.&nbsp;<i>Buono v. Nortion</i>, 371 F.3d 543, 545 (9th Cir. 2004).<br>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(2) provides that sum-<br>mary judgment is warranted when&nbsp;“the pleadings, the discov-<br>ery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show<br>that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that<br>the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” On<br>review, we determine&nbsp;“viewing the evidence in the light most<br>favorable to the non-moving party, whether there are any gen-<br>uine issues of material fact and whether the district court cor-<br>rectly applied the relevant substantive law.”&nbsp;<i>Guebara v.<br>Allstate Ins. Co</i>., 237 F.3d 987, 922 (9th Cir. 2001).&nbsp;<br>
As we noted in&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>, plaintiffs sued Baca in his official<br>
capacity, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §&nbsp;1983. 379 F.3d at 767.<br>

There is no respondeat superior liability under §&nbsp;1983.&nbsp;<i>Monell<br>v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs.</i>, 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978). We further<br>noted that Baca did not dispute that he acted on behalf of the<br>official policy of the county.&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>, 379 F.3d at 767. We<br>explained that:<br>
“a local governmental body may be liable if it has a<br>policy of inaction and such inaction amounts to a<br>failure to protect constitutional rights.”&nbsp;<i>Oviatt v.<br>Pearce,</i>&nbsp;954 F.2d 1470, 1474 (9th Cir. 1992) (citing<br><i>City of Canton v. Harris,</i>&nbsp;489 U.S. 378, 388, . . .<br>(1989)). However, the policy of inaction must be<br>more than mere negligence,&nbsp;<i>see Daniels v. Williams,<br></i>474 U.S. 327, 333-36, . . . (1986); it must be a con-<br>scious or deliberate choice among various alterna-<br>tives.&nbsp;<i>See Lee v. City of Los Angeles,</i>&nbsp;250 F.3d 668,<br>681 (9th Cir.2001).<br>
<i>Id</i>.<br>
<b>[4]</b>&nbsp;The district court ruled correctly that the evidence sub-<br>
mitted does not support a finding of deliberate indifference.<br>Since the preliminary injunction issued in&nbsp;<i>Vanke</i>&nbsp;in 1998, the<br>LASD has undergone an extensive revision of its process for<br>releasing inmates. These policy changes, which include the<br>In-Court Release, Greenband, and Early Release programs,<br>have resulted in a tremendous reduction in the number of<br>over-detentions, even according to the statistics submitted by<br>plaintiffs. Although there continue to be over-detentions, they<br>are a very small percentage of the total number of inmate<br>releases. In a jail system as large as that of Los Angeles<br>County, there are bound to be some errors due to employee<br>negligence or honest mistakes. However, given the LASD’s<br>many affirmative efforts to remedy the problem, the evidence<br>in the record will not support a finding of a policy of deliber-<br>ate indifference.<br>
<b>[5]</b>&nbsp;Plaintiffs’ evidence does not raise any material issue of<br>
fact. Although Ms. Bickley-Jones’ testimony was that she was<br>
<hr>
<A name=15></a>MORTIMER&nbsp;v. BACA<br>
2099<br>
not told the reasons for recording over-detentions, she none-<br>theless indicated that she recorded over-detentions of&nbsp;“a day<br>over” in the log book. Thus, while she may not have known<br>why she was doing so, Ms. Bickley-Jones’ testimony is that<br>she faithfully entered information concerning over-detention.<br>Capt. Jackson’s testimony concerned alleged procedures in<br>place prior to the time period in which plaintiffs were in cus-<br>tody, and plaintiffs offered no evidence that these procedures<br>continued. To the contrary, the evidence of the new programs<br>undertaken by the LASD indicates that they did not. Finally,<br>plaintiffs’ assertion that their own over-detentions were not<br>recorded in the&nbsp;“supervisor report” packets does not raise any<br>substantial question concerning the adequacy of defendant’s<br>records because plaintiffs Mortimer, Hart and Berry were all<br>released within 24 hours of when their release orders were<br>entered into the AIJS database, with the result that their over-<br>detentions would not have been entered into the ODER data-<br>base. Thus, the absence of notations about their over-<br>detentions is not evidence that the LASD&nbsp;“stopped recording<br>over-detentions of more than 24 hours but less than 48 hours.”<br>Furthermore, any such implication is overwhelmed by the<br>records submitted by both sides that show that over-detentions<br>of less than 48 hours were recorded and that the number of<br>over-detentions were substantially reduced over the years in<br>issue.<br>
<b>[6]</b>&nbsp;In sum, as we noted in&nbsp;<i>Brass</i>, plaintiffs may well have<br>
a due process right to be released within a reasonable time<br>after the basis for their detentions have ended. 328 F.3d at<br>1200.&nbsp;<i>See also Oviatt</i>, 954 F.2d at 1474 (“The Supreme Court<br>has recognized that an individual has a liberty interest in<br>being free from incarceration absent a criminal conviction.”).<br>However, for liability to attach to Baca in his official capac-<br>ity, plaintiffs must show that their over-detentions were the<br>result of a set of policies — or lack of policies — that<br>amounted to a policy of deliberate indifference.&nbsp;<i>Berry</i>, 379<br>F.3d at 773. In&nbsp;<i>Oviatt</i>, we noted that the Supreme Court had<br>indicated that a deliberate indifference exists&nbsp;“when the need<br>

for more or different action ‘is so obvious, and the inadequacy<br>[of the current procedure] so likely to result in the violation<br>of constitutional rights, that the policymakers . . . can reason-<br>ably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the<br>need.’&nbsp;” 954 F.3d at 1477-78 (quoting&nbsp;<i>City of Canton, Ohio<br>v. Harris</i>, 489 U.S. 378, 390 (1989). Whatever the situation<br>in 1998 when the district court issued a preliminary injunction<br>in&nbsp;<i>Vanke</i>, on the evidentiary record here, including the cura-<br>tive steps taken by the LASD in the years covered by this law-<br>suit, no reasonable jury could find that the defendant was<br>oblivious of, or indifferent to, over-detentions.<br>
For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s grant of sum-<br>
mary judgment in favor of defendant is&nbsp;<b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br>
