1<br>
PER&nbsp;CURIAM:<br>
2<br>
Plaintiff, a native and citizen of Ireland, commenced<br>
3<br>
this action seeking,&nbsp;<i>inter alia</i>, a declaratory judgment that<br>
4<br>
he was entitled to naturalize, as well as a grant of<br>
5<br>
naturalized citizenship following the denial of his<br>
6<br>
application by the United States Citizenship and Immigration<br>
7<br>
Services (‚ÄúCIS‚Äù). &nbsp;Plaintiff contends that the CIS<br>
8<br>
improperly denied his application because his absence from<br>
9<br>
the country for over fourteen months ‚Äì from September 16,<br>
10<br>
2004 to November 23, 2005 ‚Äì does not, as the CIS contends,<br>
Page 2 of &nbsp;9<br>
<hr>
<A name=3></a>1<br>
disqualify him from naturalized citizenship under 8 U.S.C.&nbsp;<br>
2<br>
¬ß 1427. &nbsp;The United States District Court for the Southern<br>
3<br>
District of New York (Berman,&nbsp;<i>J.</i>) denied Plaintiff‚Äôs motion<br>
4<br>
for summary judgment and granted the Defendants‚Äô cross-<br>
5<br>
motion for summary judgment, thereby affirming the decision<br>
6<br>
of the CIS. &nbsp;<i>Gildernew v. Quarantillo</i>, No. 05 Civ.<br>
7<br>
10851(RMB), 2008 WL 4938289 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 29, 2008).&nbsp;<br>
8<br>
Plaintiff now appeals from that ruling. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
9<br>
10<br>
<b>Background</b><br>
11<br>
On February 13, 2002, Plaintiff applied to the New York<br>
12<br>
District office of the former Immigration and Naturalization<br>
13<br>
Service (‚ÄúINS‚Äù) to become a naturalized citizen of the<br>
14<br>
United States. &nbsp;On December 10 of that year, he appeared<br>
15<br>
before the agency for a naturalization exam and demonstrated<br>
16<br>
his fitness for citizenship by satisfying certain statutory<br>
17<br>
criteria, including a basic knowledge of United States<br>
18<br>
history and the ability to communicate in English.&nbsp;<br>
19<br>
In April of 2004, while his application was still<br>
20<br>
pending, Plaintiff applied to the CIS (the successor agency<br>
21<br>
to the INS) for a reentry permit to allow him to return to<br>
Page 3 of &nbsp;9<br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a>1<br>
the United States after a proposed trip to Ireland to ‚Äútake<br>
2<br>
care of family affairs.‚Äù &nbsp;Plaintiff indicated that he<br>
3<br>
expected to leave the United States in June of 2004 and<br>
4<br>
remain abroad for one year. &nbsp;He did not indicate that he was<br>
5<br>
an applicant for naturalized citizenship. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
6<br>
In September of 2004, Plaintiff voluntarily left the<br>
7<br>
United States. &nbsp;Plaintiff alleges that in April 2005, he<br>
8<br>
presented for inspection at the United States Bureau of<br>
9<br>
Customs and Border Protection (‚ÄúCBP‚Äù) at Dublin Airport in<br>
10<br>
Ireland, but was told that he could not enter the United<br>
11<br>
States because he was on the ‚Äúno-fly‚Äù list maintained by the<br>
12<br>
Transportation Security Administration (‚ÄúTSA‚Äù). &nbsp;Upon a<br>
13<br>
finding that there was ‚Äúno derogatory information‚Äù on file<br>
14<br>
to preclude Plaintiff‚Äôs admission to the country, he was<br>
15<br>
ultimately permitted to return to the United States in<br>
16<br>
November of 2005.&nbsp;<br>
17<br>
On May 8, 2006, the CIS notified Plaintiff that his<br>
18<br>
application for naturalized citizenship had been approved<br>
19<br>
and scheduled a ceremony for his oath of citizenship to be<br>
20<br>
administered later that month. However, when the CIS learned<br>
21<br>
that Plaintiff had been outside the country for over<br>
Page 4 of &nbsp;9<br>
<hr>
<A name=5></a>1<br>
fourteen months, the agency issued a motion to reopen his<br>
2<br>
application. &nbsp;On July 17, 2006, the CIS denied Plaintiff‚Äôs<br>
3<br>
application because his absence from the country for over<br>
4<br>
one year while his application was pending made him<br>
5<br>
ineligible for naturalized citizenship. &nbsp;<br>
6<br>
The agency relied on 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1427, which provides in<br>
7<br>
relevant part, ‚Äú[n]o person, except as otherwise provided in<br>
8<br>
this subchapter, shall be naturalized unless such applicant<br>
9<br>
... has resided continuously within the United States from<br>
10<br>
the date of the application up to the time of admission to<br>
11<br>
citizenship.‚Äù &nbsp;¬ß 1427(a)(2). &nbsp;The statute further provides<br>
12<br>
that ‚Äú[a]bsence from the United States for a continuous<br>
13<br>
period of one year or more during the period for which<br>
14<br>
continuous residence is required for admission to<br>
15<br>
citizenship (whether preceding or subsequent to the filing<br>
16<br>
of the application for naturalization) shall break the<br>
17<br>
continuity of such residence.‚Äù &nbsp;¬ß 1427(b). &nbsp;<br>
18<br>
19<br>
&nbsp;<b>Discussion</b><br>
20<br>
21<br>
We review&nbsp;<i>de novo&nbsp;</i>a district court‚Äôs grant of summary<br>
Page 5 of &nbsp;9<br>
<hr>
<A name=6></a>1<br>
judgment. &nbsp;<i>See Sheppard v. Beerman</i>, 317 F.3d 351, 354 (2d<br>
2<br>
Cir. 2003). &nbsp;We are faced with the question of whether 8<br>
3<br>
U.S.C. ¬ß 1427 precludes the naturalization of the Plaintiff<br>
4<br>
on the facts of this case. &nbsp;Because we conclude that it<br>
5<br>
does, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.<br>
6<br>
Plaintiff first argues that the one-year absence bar in<br>
7<br>
¬ß 1427(b) applies only to the period preceding the<br>
8<br>
naturalization interview, and does not extend to the period<br>
9<br>
following the interview. &nbsp;That argument is unavailing<br>
10<br>
because it is clearly contrary to the language of the<br>
11<br>
statute. &nbsp;By its terms, ¬ß 1427(b) applies to the entire<br>
12<br>
period for which continuous residence is required, ‚Äúwhether<br>
13<br>
preceding or subsequent to the filing of the application for<br>
14<br>
naturalization.‚Äù &nbsp;Plaintiff indicates no statutory exception<br>
15<br>
that applies to his case. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
16<br>
Plaintiff does rely on language in the paragraph<br>
17<br>
preceding the one quoted above, which provides that<br>
18<br>
‚Äú[a]bsence from the United States of more than six months<br>
19<br>
but less than one year during the period for which<br>
20<br>
continuous residence is required for admission to<br>
21<br>
citizenship, immediately preceding the date of filing the<br>
Page 6 of &nbsp;9<br>
<hr>
<A name=7></a>1<br>
application for naturalization, or during the period between<br>
2<br>
the date of filing the application and the date of any<br>
3<br>
hearing under section 1447(a) of this title, shall break the<br>
4<br>
continuity of such residence.‚Äù &nbsp;¬ß 1427(b). &nbsp;Plaintiff would<br>
5<br>
have us read that paragraph to define the ‚Äúperiod for which<br>
6<br>
continuous residence is required‚Äù as only that period<br>
7<br>
‚Äúimmediately preceding the date of filing the application<br>
8<br>
for naturalization.‚Äù &nbsp;That argument fails because it is<br>
9<br>
based on a misreading of the statute. &nbsp;<br>
10<br>
First, the paragraph relied upon by Plaintiff applies<br>
11<br>
only to absences ranging from six months to less than one<br>
12<br>
year, as its prefatory words clearly indicate. &nbsp;And second,<br>
13<br>
even if that first paragraph of ¬ß 1427(b) did apply to the<br>
14<br>
circumstances of Plaintiff‚Äôs case it would not save him.&nbsp;<br>
15<br>
The paragraph does not, as Plaintiff maintains, limit the<br>
16<br>
continuous residency requirement to that period of time<br>
17<br>
preceding the filing of the application, nor even to that<br>
18<br>
period of time preceding the naturalization interview. &nbsp;The<br>
19<br>
next clause clearly states: ‚Äú<i>or during the period between</i><br>
20<br>
<i>the date of filing the application and the date of any</i><br>
21<br>
<i>hearing under section 1447(a) of this title</i>.‚Äù ¬ß<br>
Page 7 of &nbsp;9<br>
<hr>
<A name=8></a>1<br>
1427(b)(emphasis added). &nbsp;Section 1447(a) provides for an<br>
2<br>
administrative hearing before an immigration officer<br>
3<br>
following the denial of an application for naturalization.&nbsp;<br>
4<br>
The two clauses, read together, therefore embody the entire<br>
5<br>
relevant period with respect to continuous residence: the<br>
6<br>
period immediately&nbsp;<i>preceding&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>the filing of the application,<br>
7<br>
and the period&nbsp;<i>subsequent&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>to the filing of the application<br>
8<br>
until the sooner of the applicant‚Äôs admission to<br>
9<br>
citizenship, or an administrative hearing following denial<br>
10<br>
of the application. &nbsp;Because Plaintiff‚Äôs ¬ß 1447(a) hearing<br>
11<br>
occurred on or around November 26, 2006, over one year&nbsp;<i>after</i><br>
12<br>
his return to the United States, even if the first paragraph<br>
13<br>
of ¬ß 1427(b) applied to the facts of Plaintiff‚Äôs case it<br>
14<br>
would clearly be no help to him. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
15<br>
Plaintiff further contends that nothing in the<br>
16<br>
legislative history surrounding ¬ß 1427 suggests that<br>
17<br>
Congress intended for the one-year absence bar to apply<br>
18<br>
against post-interview absences. &nbsp;But because the statute is<br>
19<br>
clear and unambiguous, we will not endeavor to divine the<br>
20<br>
intent of Congress by resort to legislative history. &nbsp;<i>See</i><br>
21<br>
<i>Cervantes-Ascencio v. INS</i>, 326 F.3d 83, 86 (2d Cir. 2003).&nbsp;<br>
Page 8 of &nbsp;9<br>
<hr>
<A name=9></a>1<br>
Finally, while Plaintiff concedes that his initial<br>
2<br>
departure was voluntary, he maintains that his continued<br>
3<br>
absence was involuntary because the CBP would not permit him<br>
4<br>
to reenter the country in April of 2005, as he originally<br>
5<br>
intended. &nbsp;Plaintiff argues that it is unfair to deny him<br>
6<br>
eligibility because he attempted to return to the United<br>
7<br>
States at that time, but was prohibited from boarding his<br>
8<br>
flight as the result of bureaucratic errors on the part of<br>
9<br>
the Defendant-agencies. &nbsp;Even assuming that relief from the<br>
10<br>
clear terms of the statute would be warranted under a<br>
11<br>
different set of facts, the circumstances of this case do<br>
12<br>
not support such a result. &nbsp;Plaintiff is neither exempt from<br>
13<br>
the continuous residence requirement nor does he present a<br>
14<br>
set of facts that would warrant an estoppel. &nbsp;<br>
15<br>
16<br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
17<br>
18<br>
The Court has reviewed Plaintiff‚Äôs remaining arguments<br>
19<br>
and finds them to be without merit. &nbsp;Accordingly, the<br>
20<br>
judgment of the district court is hereby&nbsp;<b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br>
