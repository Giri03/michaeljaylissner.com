I just learned about this, but it's pretty shocking so I thought I would 
post it. Apparently a few years ago, Bush said that he uses "The Google". 

Observe:

That's pretty bad. He's the president. From this clip, 
it's pretty obvious that he doesn't use the internet. It would probably be a
useful tool for his line of work.

In a similar vein, McCain said, "Well, basically, 
**it's a Google**. You just, you know, what you can find out now on the Internet. It's remarkable, you know." Emphasis mine.

He also says, "I am a [computer] illiterate that has to rely on my wife for 
all of the assistance that I can get."

This is really, really sad. Is there **ANY** job for which you 
would deliberately hire somebody that professes internet and computer illiteracy?

Shocking.
