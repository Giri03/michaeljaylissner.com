Here's the mission folks. For the next month, I will do the following every day:

 - I will jump a rope on average 500 times.
 - I will eat no hydrogenated oil
 - I will floss every day
 - I will avoid single-passenger car usage at all costs
 - I will read a book for at least one half hour


I started this on Monday, and so far so good. It's a lot for one day - especially the car and the jumprope thing.

Will report back (hopefully) in one month.
