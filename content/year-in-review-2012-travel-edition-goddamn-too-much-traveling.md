I did a lot of traveling this year; more than anybody should ever really do. Since I'm already forgetting all the places I went to, I figured I'd write it all down. 

Here's the tally:

<table>
<tr><th>Trip</td><th>Flights</td><th>Distance (miles)</td></tr>
<tr><td>London, Germany, Turkey</td><td>9</td><td>15500</td></tr>
<tr><td>Germany for work</td><td>2</td><td>11362</td></tr>
<tr><td>Montreal Bike Trip and Visit to Montreal</td><td>2</td><td>5221</td></tr>
<tr><td>L.A., San Diego, Colorado backpacking</td><td>5</td><td>2586</td></tr>
<tr><td>Olympic Peninsula Backpacking</td><td>2</td><td>1356</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paris, Brussels</td><td>2</td><td>11092</td></tr>
<tr><td>Law via the Internet Conference at Ithaca</td><td>4</td><td>5454</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>TOTAL<strong></td><td><strong>26</strong></td><td><strong>52571</strong></td></tr>
</table>

I'm pretty sure some things are left out from the beginning of the year, and I'm still trying to figure out how I ended up doing so much goddamn traveling. For comparison's sake, I must note that the Earth is 24,901 around its belly, and this is a total of more than twice that. 

Next year will be another banner year, as I already have seven weddings on the books. I don't think there will be so many trips to Europe though. That'll make the biggest difference. 

I just hope I have enough suits. It's gonna be crazy.
