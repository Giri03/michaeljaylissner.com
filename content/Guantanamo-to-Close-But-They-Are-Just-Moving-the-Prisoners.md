I was happy to read the news today that <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/13/america/13gitmo.php?page=1" target="_blank">Obama plans to close Guant�namo Bay prison camp</a>. This is good news for America, and should be good news for the prisoners there. 

As I read up on it though, I was saddened to hear that the prisoners are just being moved to other countries. This is rather frustrating because as Noam Chomsky puts it &mdash; and I'm paraphrasing &mdash; there's only one reason to have off-site <del>torture</del> prison camps: to go around American law.

I'm really not sure what the point is in closing Guant�namo if it just means moving the prisoners elsewhere. Pretty stupid use of resources.

Here's a juicy quote from the article:<blockquote>People who have conferred with transition officials said the incoming administration appeared to have rejected a proposal to seek a new law authorizing indefinite detention inside the United States. The Bush administration has insisted that such a measure is necessary to close the Guant�namo camp and bring some detainees to the United States.</blockquote>
In other words, we could bring the prisoners to a camp in the U.S., but that would mean we couldn't hold them in tiny cells indefinitely, and that American law would be necessary. Wow. Can't have that, can we?
