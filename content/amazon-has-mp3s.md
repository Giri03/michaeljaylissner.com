It made some headlines, and is about to make more during superbowl. 
<a href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9848258-7.html?tag=newsmap">Amazon 
has started selling mp3's from all four of the major record labels.</a> It's a 
pretty cool revelation, so I went ahead and checked it out.

Guess what? Linux users, you are screwed. In order to download albums from 
Amazon, you must "Get the Amazon mp3 downloader"...which is not available for 
Linux. Excuse me? Say what? I have downloaded literally hundreds upon hundreds 
of files from the Internet, and never have I needed a special tool other than 
Firefox. Why now? 

Amazon, if you're going to do something great like this, do it whole hog. 
Don't make me install junkware. After all, I'm <i>choosing</i> to give you 
money, right?
