I've been doing some thinking, and I think that my destiny* wants me to have
a beard. Let's take a quick walk through my past, shall we?

First, I was into woodworking. I described it as, &quot;My first great 
passion.&quot; Observe this picture. It's the first hit on google images for
the word &quot;woodworker&quot;.

Next, after sort of putting woodworking aside for a while, 
I got really into hiking; thru hiking to be precise. This picture is the 
third or fourth hit for &quot;thru hiker&quot; on google images, 
but I hasten to add that it is the first hit that contains a picture of a 
person.

Finally, as you may have noticed, I'm pretty into Linux these days. It's 
could be a phase as well (we'll see), but observe this image, 
also pulled from google images. Admittedly it's not hit number one, 
but I don't count pictures of college kids or penguins out of principle.

So. It seems I should have a beard. There is a problem with this plan 
though, and to illustrate that problem, I have this picture of me, 
when I tried it for myself. Damn.

What will come after Linux? Will it be Lumberjack or hippie...time will tell. 

*Destiny is a load of bunk and we all know it deep down!
