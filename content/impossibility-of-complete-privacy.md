A short quote for you today from *<a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=721642">Property, Privacy and Personal Data</a>* by Paul M. Schwartz:<blockquote>Already in the offline world, and in no small irony, direct marketers generate and sell lists of people who have expressed an interest in protecting their privacy.</blockquote>In other words, even if you don't participate, you've participated. Gotcha.
