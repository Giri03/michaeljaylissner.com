Just some food for thought from <a href="http://thebudgetgraph.com" target="_blank">thebudgetgraph.com</a>:

 - Salary of William McGuire, CEO of UnitedHealth Group: <strong>$124M</strong>
 - Salary of Leslie Norwalk, Head Administrator of Medicare/Medicaid: <strong>$143,250</strong>
 - Salary of CEO of Walmart: <strong>$17.5M</strong>
 - Salary of Postmaster General of the USPS: <strong>$173,000</strong>
 - Highest paid federal employee, Army Football Coach Bobby Ross: <strong>$600,000</strong>
 - President's salary (perks aside): <strong>$400,000</strong>

And just to add some perspective, the USPS would be the 20th largest company above Meryl Lynch, if it were private (revenues of <strong>$78B</strong>). 

Medicare/Medicaid has a revenue of <strong>$565B</strong>; UnitedHealth Group has <strong>$45.4B</strong>.

Football is a game. 

The president rules the free world (more or less). 

Painful.
