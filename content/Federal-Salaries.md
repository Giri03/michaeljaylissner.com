Just some food for thought from <a href="http://thebudgetgraph.com">thebudgetgraph.com</a>:

 - Salary of William McGuire, CEO of UnitedHealth Group: **$124M**
 - Salary of Leslie Norwalk, Head Administrator of Medicare/Medicaid: **$143,250**
 - Salary of CEO of Walmart: **$17.5M**
 - Salary of Postmaster General of the USPS: **$173,000**
 - Highest paid federal employee, Army Football Coach Bobby Ross: **$600,000**
 - President's salary (perks aside): **$400,000**

And just to add some perspective, the USPS would be the 20th largest company above Meryl Lynch, if it were private (revenues of **$78B**). 

Medicare/Medicaid has a revenue of **$565B**; UnitedHealth Group has **$45.4B**.

Football is a game. 

The president rules the free world (more or less). 

Painful.
