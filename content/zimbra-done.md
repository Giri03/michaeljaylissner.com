I finally got Zimbra to work on Tuesday, and I must say it is one of the more frustrating things I have ever had to install. This isn't Zimbra's fault though - My rudimentary knowledge of DNS makes mail serving rather challenging. My main two difficulties when installing Zimbra stemmed from 1) not opening ALL the ports on my router that I needed to, and 2) assorted DNS difficulties mentioned above. 

Now that it is working reliably though, I'm quite pleased with it, and I've realized that it's so excellent that I am going to have to move all my mail accounts over to it very soon. It has a couple of rather pleasing functions that I'm excited about. The first is LDAP, which allows me to have the same contact list no matter how or where I get my mail. 

The second, and probably more important feature is Transport Layer Security (TLS) which creates a level of encryption between me and my server so that if an email gets as far as my server without getting eavesdropped upon, it can go that last bit of the journey from the server to me without any worries. This is a feature that for some reason I never had before now, and I'm quite glad to have it, just in case.

Other than that, it's nice to finally have webmail that's good enough that I have to think to myself about whether or not I want to check my mail in Thunderbird or Firefox. What a concept.
