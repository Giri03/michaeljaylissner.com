I hadn't mentioned this previously here on the blog, but for the past several months, I've been working my butt off putting together two grad school applications for Masters of Information Management (MIMS). The two applications were for <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">UC Berkeley School of Information</a> and <a href="http://www.ischool.washington.edu" target="_blank">University of Washington Information School</a>. 

I am elated to announce that yesterday I heard from UW, and today I heard from Cal. They have both officially offered me entrance into the Fall 2008 class. Amazing. 

I applied to the program at Cal last year and was denied, so I didn't really expect them to let me in this year, but things are looking up. Now I just have to decide which one to go to.

On the one hand, UW is a bigger program with seemingly more resources, but Cal is a smaller, leaner, and more personalized. I think it looks like I need to plan a visit to UW for an on-campus day.

Anybody have any ideas on which to go to? <!--break-->
