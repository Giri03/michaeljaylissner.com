I went snow camping with some friends in Sequoia National Park last weekend, 
and had a blast as always. We built a quinzhee and went snow shoeing and cross 
country skiing. The pictures are online if you are interested in seeing them, 
and per my custom, I brought along a couple of iButtons so that we could 
record our temperature the entire time. 

I set them up to record the temperature every five minutes to an accuracy of 
0.1 degree Celsius. I just got a chance to work with [the data][2] a bit and I 
threw together a quick chart. The data are attached, if anybody is interested, 
but the chart really tells the story better than the 2,400 data points do.
