For the record people:
<b>Quite:</b> I haven't <b>quite</b> finished my soup. This is <b>quite</b> a nice restaurant.
<b>Quiet:</b> This is a <b>quiet</b> restaurant. I enjoy peace and <b>quiet</b>.

We recently looked for roommates, and we subtracted points from anybody that wrote in their response email the word "quite" where they meant to say "quiet." It was extraordinary how many applicant roommates think they are "a quite person".
