Revolution in their minds 
The children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live 
And the hate that's in their hearts 
They're tired of being pushed around and told just what to do 
They'll fight the world until they've won and love comes flowing through
 
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today 
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear? 
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? Yeah!
 
So you children of the world listen to what I say 
If you want a better place to live in spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive you must be brave 
Or you children of today are children of the grave yeah!<!--break-->
