As anybody who has been following my <a href="http://twitter.com/mlissner">twitter stream</a> today knows, I have been spending the entire day hunting, pecking, avoiding, and kind of working on my final exam for my <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~bcarver/mediawiki/index.php/Intellectual_Property_Law_for_the_Information_Industries_Syllabus">Intellectual Property Law Class</a>.

While working on the exam, I have found some real legal gems today. These 
kinds of things don't often turn up unless you know to look for them, and 
since I'm betting nobody ever looks, I figured I'd share them here.

 - First, a warm up. May I present the laws that protects the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000706----000-.html">Red Cross</a>, and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00220506----000-.html">The Olympics</a>?
 - Or, perhaps the ones that define and protect (sort of) America's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000301----000-.html">anthem (Star Spangled Banner)</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000302----000-.html">motto ("In God we trust")</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000303----000-.html">floral emblem (the rose)</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000304----000-.html">march (Stars and Stripes Forever)</a>, and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000305----000-.html">tree (the mighty oak)</a>?
 - Maybe you'd prefer a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sup_01_36_06_I_08_A_10_1.html">list of the national observances</a> that are codified by law, such as the May, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000139----000-.html">Steelmark month</a>?
 - And finally, those laws that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sup_01_36_06_I_08_A_10_5.html">govern the inauguration</a>, including <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000504----000-.html">the regulations of the electricity</a> that day.

America, sometimes you have the strangest laws.
