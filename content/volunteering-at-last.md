For the last couple of years I've kinda, sorta been hunting on and off for a place where I could volunteer some of my free time. I started at the nearby university, thinking that I might be able to convince some kind professor to teach me some things. When that failed, I tried searching google for nonprofits that looked interesting. Failing that, I went on a limb, and asked a professor of mine if he had any ideas (he did, but they fell through). 

Finally, after all this time, one fell in my lap.  Last week, I was looking for a place where I could donate my <a href="http://www.michaeljaylissner.com/blog/new-computer-and-give-away-pile">old computer hardware</a>, and I discovered the <a href="http://www.accrc.org/" target="_blank">Alameda County Computer Recycling Center</a>. It looks pretty darned cool. I will spend my time putting together old computers into useful devices, and then installing Ubuntu or Suse. In exchange, they will give computers (for free) to needy parties. 

It's not helping the homeless, but it should be educational for me and, ultimately for them. Plus, it will help to keep e-waste out of landfills.
