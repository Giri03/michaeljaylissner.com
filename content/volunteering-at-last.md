For the last couple of years I've kinda, sorta been hunting on and off for 
a place where I could volunteer some of my free time. I started at the 
nearby university, thinking that I might be able to convince some kind 
professor to teach me some things. When that failed, 
I tried searching google for nonprofits that looked interesting. Failing 
that, I went on a limb, and asked a professor of mine if he had any ideas 
(he did, but they fell through). 

Finally, after all this time, one fell in my lap.  Last week, 
I was looking for a place where I could donate my [old computer 
hardware][1], and I discovered the [Alameda County Computer Recycling 
Center][2]. It looks pretty darned cool. I will spend my time putting 
together old computers into useful devices, and then installing Ubuntu or 
Suse. In exchange, they will give computers (for free) to needy parties. 

It's not helping the homeless, but it should be educational for me and, 
ultimately for them. Plus, it will help to keep e-waste out of landfills.
