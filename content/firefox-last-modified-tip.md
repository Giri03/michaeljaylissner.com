I spend a lot of time researching things on the Internet, and I've noticed a problem with regards to the answers I find. Frequently, after researching something for a while, I discover what appears to be the answer I am looking for, but people are notoriously bad when it comes to dating the things they write.

Yesterday, while scanning the news, I discovered <a href="http://www.cnet.com/workers-edge/8301-13880_1-9835822-68.html?tag=head">this article</a>, which explains that in Firefox if you type "<strong>javascript:alert(document.lastModified)</strong>" into the address bar, it will show a pop-up indicating when the page was - you guessed it - last modified.

This is a VERY handy tip, and I realized that if you hit Ctrl+B in Firefox, and then right-click in the sidebar > Create new bookmark, you can even save it as a bookmark, so that if you ever want to know when a page was modified, it's a piece of cake to find out. The one shortcoming of this is that it won't work on dynamically generated pages, such as this one.
