Well, it seems somebody is reading my blog after all. After reading <a href="http://www.michaeljaylissner.com/blog/meet-my-enemy">my post regarding my hate of Fiji water</a>, Fiji has responded by <a href="http://www.fijigreen.com" target="_blank">creating a new website</a> that tries to lure consumers out of their minds.

I think it's great that Fiji Water wants to lower their carbon impact, but come on folks. Talk about green-washing. This is just stupid. If you care about the environment, stop bottling water in Fiji. Actually, just stop bottling water.
