Well, it seems somebody is reading my blog after all. After reading [my post
regarding my hate of Fiji water][1], Fiji has responded by [creating a new 
website][2] that tries to lure consumers out of their minds.

I think it's great that Fiji Water wants to lower their carbon impact, 
but come on folks. Talk about green-washing. This is just stupid. If you 
care about the environment, stop bottling water in Fiji. Actually, 
just stop bottling water. 

The end.
