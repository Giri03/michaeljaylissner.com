Well, there is an interesting development in the theft of my credit card number. Today I received supplements in the mail for my prostate. Supplements that were bought with my credit card. For those wondering, no, I do not need this medicine. No, I did not order this medicine. 

I'm intrigued and a bit amused that this is what my identity thief decided to do with my money, but I'm going to have to decline their offer of prostate supplements. This purchase raises so many questions, I don't know exactly where to begin.
