}

I have been rather busy since starting this blog many months ago, so I never got to finish rounding out its features. One that I have been wanting to figure out and to apply was Drupal's taxonomy feature, which allows you to categorize your content as you write it.

After I turned it on today, I had to make up about 40 terms categorizing the content that I have written thus far, and I am now in the process of quickly going through and applying these tags to my old entries. What's cool about having this feature turned on is that in the future, say, when I have 80 gazillion entries about various topics, if you are a reader of the blog, you can easily find entries matching your interests. Assuming, of course, that I write 80 gazillion things.
