I realized today that for some reason I never posted this paper back in May when I wrote it. This paper is a brief analysis of the ways that our fourth amendment rights are being daily eroded by technology marching on. I didn't go too deeply into the importance of the fourth amendment (I probably should have), but if you're not up on your rights (or lack thereof), you might find this to be interesting reading.
