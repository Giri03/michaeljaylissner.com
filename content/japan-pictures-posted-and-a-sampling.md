N and I got back from Japan a few weeks ago, and we've finally gotten the 
pictures posted. If you're interested, let me know and I'll send you a link
to the whole collection.

For now though, here are some samples of some of the good ideas, bad ideas,
and funny signs we saw.

Starting with the funny signs...

![No alt](/images/japan/Actually,%20keep%20out.jpg)

> No camping, lighting fires, or...actually, while we're at it, just stay out 
altogether.

If we just had more signs like this one, the world would be a better place.

![No alt](/images/japan/Foods%20mall.jpg)

> No! It's fine, our food won't hurt you. Really!

![No alt](/images/japan/Gentle%20Man.jpg)

> I won't hurt you either, I'm a gentle fellow. Look, I have a sign.

![No alt](/images/japan/My%20Head.jpg)

Being 6'6" tall, this one hit close to home.

![No alt](/images/japan/No%20danger.jpg)

No danger allowed here folks. No danger allowed.

![No alt](/images/japan/No%20Smoking.jpg)

For that matter, no pipe smoking is allowed either. Because lots of 
Japanese smoke pipes.

![No alt](/images/japan/The%20Japan%20Times.jpg)

In Japan newspapers will not have FEAR!

![No alt](/images/japan/Please%20use%20it%20willingly.jpg)

It's important to use doors willingly.

Moving onto the good and bad Japanese ideas....

![No alt](/images/japan/Airplane%20camera.jpg)

Check out the screen, that's a camera mounted on the bottom of the plane.

![No alt](/images/japan/Bag%20lady.jpg)

This woman sits and polishes and cleans empty plastic bags. All. Day. Long.
Recycling at its best/worst.

![No alt](/images/japan/Bikes%20as%20stroller.jpg)

Look closely at these bikes. They can fit two kids on the bike itself. No 
trailers, not frills. Just useful, functional bikes.

![No alt](/images/japan/Cross%20scissors.jpg)

OK, these are the worst idea ever. The Christians put a cross into the blade
of the scissor. So much for having scissors that actually work.

![No alt](/images/japan/Nightlite.jpg)

Check this out: Not only do florescent bulbs glow in the dark, 
but night lights are built into most overhead lights. 

![No alt](/images/japan/Packaged%20apples.jpg)

Japan takes apples seriously. Judge the wisdom yourself, I suppose.

![No alt](/images/japan/Soundless%20Refrigerator.jpg)

They've done it. They've made a silent fridge for hotel rooms.

![No alt](/images/japan/Tame%20deer.jpg)

On the other hand, they've tamed deer. This is a terrible idea. Deer are 
annoying. See [here][1] for details.

![No alt](/images/japan/Umbrella%20racks.jpg)

And finally, an umbrella rack with locks and keys, so everybody gets their umbrella back. What a crazy concept.
