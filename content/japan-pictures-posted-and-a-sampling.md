}

My girlfriend and I got back from Japan a few weeks ago, and we've finally gotten the pictures posted. If you're interested, let me know and I'll send you a link to the whole collection.

For now though, here are some samples of some of the good ideas, bad ideas, and funny signs we saw.

Starting with the funny signs...<!--break-->
<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Actually,%20keep%20out.jpg">
"No camping, lighting fires, or...actually, while we're at it, just stay out all together."

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Do%20it%20at%20the%20office.jpg">
If we just had more signs like this one, the world would be a better place.

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Foods%20mall.jpg">
"No! It's fine, our food won't hurt you. Really!"

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Gentle%20Man.jpg">
"I won't hurt you either, I'm a gentle fellow. Look, I have a sign."

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/My%20Head.jpg">
Being 6'6" tall, this one hit close to home.

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/No%20danger.jpg">
No danger allowed here folks. No danger allowed.

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/No%20Smoking.jpg">
For that matter, no pipe smoking is allowed either. Because lots of Japanese smoke pipes.

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/The%20Japan%20Times.jpg">
In Japan newspapers will not have FEAR!

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Please%20use%20it%20willingly.jpg">
It's important to use doors willingly.

Moving onto the good and bad Japanese ideas....
<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Airplane%20camera.jpg">
Check out the screen, that's a camera mounted on the bottom of the plane.

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Bag%20lady.jpg">
This woman sits and polishes and cleans empty plastic bags. All. Day. Long. Recycling at its best/worst.

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Bikes%20as%20stroller.jpg">
Look closely at these bikes. They can fit two kids on the bike itself. No trailers, not frills. Just useful, functional bikes.

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Cross%20scissors.jpg">
OK, these are the worst idea ever. The Christians put a cross into the blade of the scissor. So much for having scissors that actually work.

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Nightlite.jpg">
Check this out: Not only do florescent bulbs glow in the dark, but night lights are built into most overhead lights. 

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Packaged%20apples.jpg">
Japan takes apples seriously. Judge the wisdom yourself, I suppose.

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Soundless%20Refrigerator.jpg">
They've done it. They've made a silent fridge for hotel rooms.

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Tame%20deer.jpg">
On the other hand, they've tamed deer. This is a terrible idea. Deer are annoying. See <a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/node/403">here</a> for details.

<img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Umbrella%20racks.jpg">
And finally, an umbrella rack with locks and keys, so everybody gets their umbrella back. What a crazy concept.
