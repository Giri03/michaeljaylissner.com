Just a quick note today to announce that pictures from last weekend are 
posted in the photo area for those of you that have logins. 

It was a fantastic weekend. Some friends and I decided to go to Yosemite to
go hiking, show shoeing and camping. All in all, Yosemite remains one of 
the most beautiful places on earth. The pictures are impressive, 
but they still can't tell the whole story. Enjoy.
