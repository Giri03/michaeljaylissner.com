I blogged <a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/blog/firefox-last-modified-tip">a while back</a> about a Firefox command that would tell you the last modified date of the page you were looking at, and it got me thinking....what is the age of the Internet on the whole?

I've been thinking about it a bit, and it seems like knowing this kind of information could prove pretty useful for certain circles. If there was a way to summarize the last modified date of every page on the Internet, we could pretty easily figure out how useful the information is. 

Firefox add-on?
