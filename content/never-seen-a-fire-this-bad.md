Well, last I read, it looked like about 500,000 people have been evacuated down in San Diego because of the fires. This is a bad one folks. All the fire fighters are saying that they've never seen a fire this bad, and last I heard, containment was around 5%. That's probably an over estimation.

KPBS is maintaining a Google Map of the affairs. Yellow is evacuated areas; red is fire.
