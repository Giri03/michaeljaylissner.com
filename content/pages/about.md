<h3>The Blog</h3>
This blog was started in September 2007 for me to voice anything that crosses my mind and that I feel warrants further thought. Often that is software, sometimes it is money, and more often than not it is something else.

<h3>The Software</h3>
This site runs on a VPS provided by <a href="http://slicehost.com" target="_blank">slicehost.com</a>. Prior to using their services, I ran the site for about two years out of my attic. The VPS is loaded up with the <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal CMS system</a> and an <a href="http://ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> LAMP stack. 

You're looking at the fourth version of this site. The third version was much the same with regards to content, but with the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Pleroma" target="_blank">Pleroma</a> theme. It looked something like <a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/oldsitev3/Site%20v3.png"> this</a>.  The <a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/oldsite/index.htm">second version</a> was hand-coded in the Fedora and Ubuntu environments utilizing vim.

The <a href="/archive/oldsite/archive/assets/homepage.gif">first version</a> was made in 2004 in the Windows XP Professional environment utilizing Adobe Photoshop, Macromedia Dreamweaver CS, Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.

<h3 id="privacy">Your Privacy</h3>
I don't collect much information on this site, except through blog comments and messages sent to me through the contact page. I won't do evil with the info collected on these pages, meaning that I won't share it with others unless you ask me to, I won't post it publicly, and I'll delete it if you ask me to. Generally speaking, I'll simply treat your data with the respect it deserves.

I should mention however that similar to the Google Analytics system, <a href="http://knowprivacy.org/">which is on 88% of web domains</a>, at present I use <a href="http://piwik.com" target="_blank">Piwik</a> on this site to learn about how the site is used. Among other things, this tool collects <em><strong>anonymous</strong></em> information about how you found my site, some information about your computer, what country you are from, and what network provider you use. In the case of some large organizations, this may mean that I may know that a visitor from your organization visited my site.

To see the kinds of information that is collected by Piwik, please feel free to play with their <a href="http://piwik.org/demo/">online demo</a>. For now, I have not allowed access to my own stats for fear of a repeat of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_scandal">AOL scandal</a>.
