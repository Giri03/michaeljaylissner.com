## The Blog

This blog was started in September 2007 for me to voice anything that 
crosses my mind and that I feel warrants further thought. Often that is 
software, sometimes it is money, and more often than not it is something else.

## The Software

Starting in late 2014, the site has been run on Github pages and generated 
using the [Pelican][4] static site generator. This system makes the blog 
extremely fast and allows it to be run using extremely little hardware. Even
the search engine is pre-computed and rendered client-side. 

For about five years prior to this, this site ran on a VPS provided by 
[Rackspace (n√©e slicehost.com)][1]. Ultimately, this became a headache whenever the site got a 
surge in traffic, as that would cause Rackspace to shut me down. On top 
of that, Rackspace cost money each month that a static site doesn't. During 
this time, the site ran on the venerable [Drupal CMS][2] with an [Ubuntu][3] 
LAMP stack backing that up. 

Prior to running it on Rackspace, I ran the site for about two years out of my
attic.

You're looking at the fifth version of this site. 

The fourth version was run on Drupal, and looked something like this:

![Site v4]({filename}/images/oldsite/v4.png)

The third version was much the same with regards to content and technology, 
but with the [Pleroma theme][5]. It looked something like this:

![Site v3]({filename}/images/oldsite/v3.png)

Wandering further back in time, the [second version][6] was hand-coded in the 
Fedora and Ubuntu environments utilizing vim. It looked something like this:

![Site v2]({filename}/images/oldsite/v2.png)

You can [still kinda browse that one][6] even today.

The [first version][7] was made in 2004 in the Windows XP Professional 
environment utilizing Adobe Photoshop, Macromedia Dreamweaver CS, Internet 
Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. It was a dark time, but even that one [still 
kind of works][8]. It looked something like this:

![Site v1]({filename}/images/oldsite/v1.png)

*Yes, it was made by a five year old.*

## Your Privacy

I don't collect much information on this site, except through blog comments
and messages sent to me through the contact page. I won't do evil with the
info collected on these pages, meaning that I won't share it with others 
unless you ask me to, I won't post it publicly, and I'll delete it if you 
ask me to. Generally speaking, I'll simply treat your data with the respect
it deserves.

I should mention however that similar to the Google Analytics system, 
<a href="http://knowprivacy.org/">which is on 88% of web domains</a>, 
at present I use <a href="http://piwik.com">Piwik</a> on 
this site to learn about how the site is used. Among other things, 
this tool collects ***anonymous*** information about how you found 
my site, some information about your computer, what country you are from, 
and what network provider you use. In the case of some large organizations,
this may mean that I may know that a visitor from your organization 
visited my site.

To see the kinds of information that is collected by Piwik, 
please feel free to play with their <a href="http://piwik.org/demo/">online
demo</a>. For now, I have not allowed access to my own stats for fear of a 
repeat of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_scandal">AOL scandal</a>.
