It's my winter break right now, so I'm taking advantage of it by doing some 
of the things that have been on my list for far too long. One of those 
things was to build a repair stand for the work I do on the bikes in my life. 
For about $50, you can build this stand, which works remarkably well.

Essentially, what you need to make this beauty is five pipes, 
a 90 degree elbow, a 45 degree elbow, and a welder. Since I don't weld, 
I went to [a local muffler shop][1] and they were happy to do it (for 
free!) The one big lesson I'll share is that you can't (and shouldn't) make
this from galvanized metal, since welding that [is dangerous][2]. The 
stuff you want is called "black pipe."
