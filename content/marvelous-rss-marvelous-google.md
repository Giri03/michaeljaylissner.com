I've been working on the site a fair amount lately, and have added a couple of new features. The first one is a set of those ubiquitous bookmarking buttons for Technorati, del.icio.us, etc. that you should be seeing if you are reading this online. I've been trying to optimize this blog for a bit, and I figured I probably need these sooner or later.

The other thing I added today is the "Subscribe" block, which for the moment is listed on the left under the recent music. I did a little playing around in the heart of Drupal, and modified this block so that it has text links for RSS and for an email service I just discovered from Google.
