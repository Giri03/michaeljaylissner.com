I've been working on the site a fair amount lately, and have added a couple of 
new features. The first one is a set of those ubiquitous bookmarking buttons 
for Technorati, del.icio.us, etc. that you should be seeing if you are reading 
this online. I've been trying to optimize this blog for a bit, and I figured 
I probably need these sooner or later.

The other thing I added today is the "Subscribe" block, which for the moment 
is listed on the left under the recent music. I did a little playing around in 
the heart of Drupal, and modified this block so that it has text links for 
RSS and for an email service I just discovered from Google.
