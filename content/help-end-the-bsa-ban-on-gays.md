On May 3rd, the Boy Scouts are considering lifting their ban on gays, and are putting a vote to the local and national councils. This means that it's easy to influence the vote by calling in and expressing your opinion. It's simple to do so, and more voices could change the direction of the Boy Scouts of America, allowing all boys to be included and accepted. 

Here's what to do:

1. [Find your local council][1]
2. Give them a call or send them an email telling them your opinion.
3. Contact the national council via email: <a href="mailto:feedback@scouting.org">feedback@scouting.org</a>.

Most important is to contact your local council. We need their phones to be ringing off the hook with people expressing their opinions. It truly takes no more than two minutes. Here's the San Diego council: (619) 298-6121, and the East Bay council: (925) 674-6100.

If you prefer a form letter, you can [just do this one through the Human Rights Campaign][2] (34,000 people already have).

Here's a simple transcript for you to follow:

> I'm [calling/wrriting] to express my desire that the Boy Scouts immediately lift their ban on gays. This ban is discriminatory, outdated and pointless. Scouting teaches many great lessons to thousands of adolescents across the U.S. One lesson that Scouting should not teach is that homosexuality is somehow wrong or means for discrimination. 

> On May 3rd, I hope that you will help the BSA finally makes the right decision so it can continue to lead boys into being mature and accepting men.

Send this to the email above, and call your local council. This could make a difference.
