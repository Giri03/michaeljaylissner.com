Yesterday and today I've been in Ithaca, New York, participating in the Law via the Internet Conference (LVI), where I've been learning tons!

I had the good fortune to have my proposal topic selected for [Track 4: Application Development for Open Access and Engagement][1].

In the interest of sharing, I've attached the latest version of my slides to this Blog post, and the audio for the talk may eventually get posted [on the LVI site][2].
