I played around with a new site today called <a href="http://wattzon.com" target="_blank">WattzOn.com</a> that helps you to figure out how much energy your existence consumes on a daily basis. It's a pretty useful site because it asks pretty thorough questions, and then reports on you vs. historical American, you vs. the world, you vs. lightbulbs, etc. Here's my consumption of energy:

Pretty cool right? Who knew that my biggest environmental damage is coming from government? Here's me vs. historical Americans:

So I'm doing pretty well relative to the average American, and I need to follow Thoreau's advice about not paying my taxes. Got it.
