A few weeks ago, we made a fairly major change at CourtListener.com to include 
ID numbers in all of our case URLs. This change meant that links that were 
previously like this:

    http://courtlistener.com/scotus/Wong-v.-Smith/
    
Are now like this:

    http://courtlistener.com/scotus/V5o/wong-v-smith/
    
Most of the old links should continue to work, but using the new links should 
be much faster and more reliable. The major difference between the two is the 
ID number, which is encoded as a set of numbers (in this case *V5o*). This 
ID corresponds directly with the ID number in our database, aiding us greatly 
in serving up cases quickly and accurately.

Around the same time as this change, we added social networking links to all 
of our case pages to make them easier to share with friends and colleagues. 
These links use our new tiny domain, *http://crt.li/*, and should thus be 
ideal for websites like Twitter or Reddit.

In the next few months we will be getting a major new server, and will be 
migrating our data to it. This will allow us to serve more data, 
and&mdash;drum roll please&mdash;will allow us to begin serving audio content 
on the site. That's right, in the next few months, we will begin getting oral 
arguments from the circuit courts, and will be serving it directly to you on 
the case pages. 

We also have plans to revisit our search interface in order to add date 
filtering and query building so look for that soon.

As always, we welcome your feedback and support, so don't hesitate to get in 
touch with us if you have any questions or suggestions.
