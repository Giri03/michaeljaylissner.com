It's coming down to the end of the semester, and after I finished the attached paper on FTC laws as the apply to online advertising, I did some calculations to figure out what I have to do still. 

Turns out I have 68-95 pages to write (give or take), and two projects to complete between today and early May. Things are going to get interesting. 

The lay of the land looks like this:

 - Two law/policy papers - total of 35-50 pages
 - One sociology paper - 25-35 pages
 - A final project combining some aesthetics work I have been doing
 - Two technology strategy assessments - total of eight pages
 - And an online project - watch for this soon


For now, I'll reserve my thoughts on the attached analysis, but I tried to analyze the ways that the FTC regulates online advertising...within an eight page limit.
