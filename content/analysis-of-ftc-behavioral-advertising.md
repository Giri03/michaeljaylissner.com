}

It's coming down to the end of the semester, and after I finished the attached paper on FTC laws as the apply to online advertising, I did some calculations to figure out what I have to do still. 

Turns out I have 68-95 pages to write (give or take), and two projects to complete between today and early May. Things are going to get interesting. 

The lay of the land looks like this:<ul><li>Two law/policy papers - total of 35-50 pages</li>
<li>One sociology paper - 25-35 pages</li>
<li>A final project combining some aesthetics work I have been doing</li>
<li>Two technology strategy assessments - total of eight pages</li>
<li>And an online project - watch for this soon</li></ul>

For now, I'll reserve my thoughts on the attached analysis, but I tried to analyze the ways that the FTC regulates online advertising...within an eight page limit.
