Well, I can't say I have had a serious blog before, so with this very sentence, I am forging new ground for myself, and through the strange magic of the Internet, for everybody else in the world (except China, who I will now block from this blog by writing the following word: &quot;democracy&quot;).
 
There's a pressure here of course not to have any typos and to make this post significant and poignant, but if I know me - and I think I do - I shouldn't set high bars like that for myself. I should just enjoy the medium, allow mistakes early and often, and proceed with the reason I am here to write today, which, according to the title of this post is to discuss the software of this very blog.

It's an interesting thing setting up a blog in your house. For some reason, it's really bloody complicated. First, you've got to learn how your house is networked, then how the Internet is networked. Once you think you've got that figured out, you have to get a faster Internet connection (cable as opposed to DSL), and if you are feeling spry, perhaps a static IP. I'm not feeling spry, and so, dyndns.com is my friend. 

The next step once the networking is figured out is to figure out the software and hardware sides of things. This is not an easy task either. In the end, I have set up two computers to run this here blog. One to run Drupal, Apache, etc., and the other to do the mail serving. For the CMS, I have chosen Drupal because it seems to be all the rage, and because it has a stupid song that got caught in my head for far too long (see youtube for details). Drupal is of course running on GNU+Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL. As for the mail server, it would be running Zimbra, but at the moment it is crashed. I can't make it stop overheating, and it's rather annoying. 

Anyway, once that's up and going, everything should be a go, and I will be a proud Internet host. Only one question truly remains: Is my IP on an anti-spam blacklist? We shall soon find out. <!--break-->
