There has been some talk in my family over the years about my great 
grandfather, Meyer Lissner. Over the holidays, I scanned some old photos, 
and discovered that he was quite the famous fellow. Below is a [liberty 
ship][1] that was named after him in 1943.

I also learned that my grandfather donated a **LOT** of his 
papers to the Stanford Library as the [Meyer Lissner Papers][2]. I haven't 
read up much on him yet, but he seems pretty influential to California 
history as part of a reform movement. 

Interesting stuff. I'm going to have to do some researching on this fellow 
one of these days.
