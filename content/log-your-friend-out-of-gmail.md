}

I keep having this problem where I want to use somebody's computer to check my gmail, but I know that if I go to mail.google.com, I will see their email. I was thinking about this last night, and I came up with two solutions. The first was to bookmark the gmail logout link into their browser or maybe del.icio.us so that I could visit it without having to go to their gmail, and the second solution was to post that link here. 

So, if you know that you want to log out your friend from gmail without seeing their inbox, all you have to do is <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?logout&hl=en-GB">click here</a>.
