}

Back in '05 when I hiked from Mexico to Canada on the Pacific Crest Trail, I 
carried a little device called an <a href="http://www.iButton.com" target="_blank">iButton</a>. 
This little device contains essentially three things: a clock, a bit of memory 
and a thermometer. It's waterproof, accurate to 0.1 degree Celsius, and is about 
the size of five dimes stacked one upon another. There are a bunch of silly 
things you can do with these, but what I chose to do with mine was to have it 
record the temperature every hour on the hour for the entire time I was hiking, 
with the idea being to get some good data about the temperature out there on 
the PCT.

All in all, you can figure that the temperature was recorded 24 times a day 
for about 150 days, for an astounding 3600 data points, and about 150 
oscillations from the daytime high to the nighttime low. I've spent some time 
working with the data, and it's pretty much impossible to make much use of....unless 
you write a program to interpret it. You can 
<a href="http://charityhikers.org/pct/temps.htm" target="_blank">see it for 
yourself</a> if you're interested.

Well, as fate should have it, I am currently enrolled in a Java programming 
class, and I have the option of doing a final project of my own choosing. 
Having not put this data to good use has been a burden on my soul for a 
couple of years now, and I've decided to make my final project an applet that 
will allow a user to plot this data on a graph for any date range and any time 
range that they choose (e.g. 5pm to 10pm for September 20th to 23rd).  

Once this is done, I will attempt to post it here, but here's the question to 
you dear reader, do you have any suggestions as to features that you would be 
interested in seeing in an applet of this sort? Thoughts?

I'm quite excited about getting this info out there. Finally.
