A few weeks back, I mentioned that I was having some trouble setting up the Zimbra Suite on my server. I finally got it to work, but it wasn't as reliable as I needed it to be. When I looked into the problem, it seemed I just needed a newer computer to run it. Apparently they were serious when they talked about the minimum hardware requirements (who knew?).

I thought about just running a lighter-weight piece of software, but after I priced it out, I learned that I could get a new computer (sans monitor, keyboard, speakers, mouse and hard drives) for only $350. So I did. I just finished putting it together* and getting Zimbra working again (which was easy since I used the old hard drives), and now I've got a give away pile.

Here's the list:

 - One computer, sans hard drive. It's a P3, it's got about a gig of RAM, graphics card, integrated ethernet. The case is a beaut, but it weighs in at about 20 lbs. If you get it a set of matched processors, it's actually kind of fast - 
 - A P3 processor and heat sink
 - Four SDRAM spacers
 - Working keyboard
 - Two DSL Modems


And that's it. That computer could work well for somebody that does light computing. The rest is probably garbage, but you never know. Any takers?

*The specs, in case somebody is interested, are meager, but still infinitely faster than the predecessor. The new computer is a Intel Duo, 2.13Ghz ($150), 2GB of RAM ($70) and cheap motherboard with integrated video, sound and ethernet ($40).
