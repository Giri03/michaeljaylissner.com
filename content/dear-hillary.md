Dear Hillary, 

It seems you have lost the contest, and it's time that you accept that fact. I won't say you ran a good race, but you really did put one heck of a lot of effort. By <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21660914">my count</a> though, there are 313 delegates remaining. Obama needs to get 72 of them. You need 243. 

I think it's time to throw in the towel, and - dare I say it - move on. Please?
