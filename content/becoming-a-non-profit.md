## The Goal

This post is an attempt to document the things that we've done at [Free Law Project][flp] to get our official Federal and State non-profit status. This has been a grueling process for Brian and me but as we announced on Twitter, we now have it officially in hand, and likely in record time:

Check out [this beauty][status-letter]!

All through the process, I wished there was something that had all the documentation of the process, so this is my attempt at such a post. I'm writing this after the fact, so I expect that I'll munge a few details. If you catch me at it, you can either [edit this page][gh] yourself using [my handy guide][guide], or you can [send me a note][contact] and I'll update it.

    1. Write Bylaws
    1. Write Articles of Incorporation
    1. Write Conflict of Interest and Ethics Policy
    1. Hold a meeting creating directors (and having them resign as incorporators, if necessary)
    1. Hold a meeting to ratify and adopt everything above.
    1. File Statement of Information with Secretary of State (90 days since incorporation)
1. Get Federal recognition (501(c)(3))
