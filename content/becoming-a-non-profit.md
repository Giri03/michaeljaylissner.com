## The Goal

This post is an attempt to document the things that we've done at [Free Law Project][flp] to get our official Federal and State non-profit status. This has been a grueling process for Brian and me but as we announced on Twitter, we now have it officially in hand, and likely in record time:

Check out [this beauty][status-letter]!

All through the process, I wished there was something that had all the documentation of the process, so this is my attempt at such a post. I'm writing this after the fact, so I expect that I'll munge a few details. If you catch me at it, you can either [edit this page][gh] yourself using [my handy guide][guide], or you can [send me a note][contact] and I'll update it. 


## The Overall Process

Here are the major steps for California and Federal recognition:

1. Reserve the name of your organization with the Secretary of State
1. Check for Trademarks on your organization name
1. Get an EIN from the IRS
1. Get State recognition (California)
    1. Write Bylaws
    1. Write Articles of Incorporation
    1. Write Conflict of Interest and Ethics Policy
    1. Hold a meeting creating directors (and having them resign as incorporators, if necessary)
    1. Hold a meeting to ratify and adopt everything above.
1. File Statement of Information with Secretary of State (90 days since creation of your EIN)
1. Register with the California Attorney General's registry of charitable trusts
1. Get Federal recognition (501(c)(3))
    1. IRS-1023
    1. Your organization's press coverage
    1. Your homepage
    1. Articles of Incorporation stamped by the State Secretary
1. Get Municipal recognition


## Reserve Your Name with the Secretary of State

This is an important step to take if you think somebody else might already have your name or if you think it might get scooped up before you finish your paperwork. This is your opportunity to say that your organization is named such-and-such and nobody else can have that name.

More information about this can be [found on the Secretary of State's website][sos-name]. The process involves downloading [a form][sos-reserve], filling it out and then waiting for a reply. Once you get the reply, the name is yours for 60 days. This is probably also a good time to...
  
## Check for Trademarks

If you think the name of your organization might be a trademark, you should check [the USPTO's trademark database][tmdb] to see if it is. If so, it's probably wise to re-think the name of your organization. Naming your organization the Nike Corp. probably won't work out.  

## Get an EIN

This is the official step that's required to incorporate your organization and it's a fairly easy one. Once this is done you'll have an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS. 

To do this, there is [a multi-step form on the IRS website][EIN-form]. Work your way through it, and if you come out the other side, you'll quickly be the owner of a freshly minted EIN. 

XXX Brian: I forget, did they give us the PDF immediately, or did they mail this to us?


## Get State Recognition

At this point, you've moved past the easy stuff. It's time for the weird and difficult paperwork.

### Write Bylaws, Articles of Incorporation and Conflict of Interest and Ethics Policy

Writing these three items is a very persnickety part of the process. Each item *must* include certain phrases and failure to include those phrases will lambaste any attempt to 501(c)(3) status down the road. The template we used for each of these was created by XXX and can be downloaded from [their website][template-source]. 
 
The best process we discovered for this was to very carefully work our way through each template and to update any section that needed it. The [result][bylaws-and-aoi] clocks in at 25 pages for the Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation and ten pages for the  Conflict of Interest and Ethics Policy.

## Hold Some Meetings 

OK, you've got your name, EIN, Bylaws, Articles of Incorporation and  Conflict of Interest and Ethics Policy all ready. Now what? Well, now we enter the portion of the process that involves magic and wizardry. What we do now is we hold two meetings. You're free to chant during these meetings.

The first meeting serves the purpose of creating directors and having them resign as incorporators, if necessary. To have this meeting, get all of your incorporators and board members together and decide to make it so. Have your secretary keep minutes from the meeting. You'll need them for the 501(c)(3). [Here are ours][minutes-incorporators]. You can see how this might feel a bit like voodoo magic if your board of directors is the same group of people as your incorporators (as in our case). 
   
The second meeting is where the real business goes down. Here you adopt all of the paperwork you created above, establish bank accounts, etc. Again, we used the templates from XXX to keep minutes for this meeting. [Check out our minutes for details][minutes-first-meeting]. You'll also see in our minutes a waiver of notice that waives the director's normal requirement to tell people about the meeting in advance.

Note that these two meetings can take place back to back, but that they need to have *separate* minutes and need to be *separate* meetings. This is because until the board is adopted in the first meeting, they can't very well do the things in the second meeting. Voodoo? Perhaps.
