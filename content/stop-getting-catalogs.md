<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.catalogchoice.org/badge.js?color=green"></script>Just a quick post today to promote <a href="http://catalogchoice.org" target="_blank">Catalog Choice.org</a>. I've been using it now for the past six months, and I am beginning to reap the fruit of my labors.

It's a pretty slick site that I recommend everybody sign up for. Essentially, once you're signed up, whenever you get junk mail, you log into the site, look up the publisher, and opt out. They contact the publisher on your behalf, and you're done.

I've come across a couple of pieces of junk mail so far that aren't in their database, but I have suggested those items to Catalog Chioce, and they say they'll get to them. 

The site itself is sponsored by the <a href="http://ecologycenter.org" target="_blank">Ecology Center</a> and the <a href="http://nwf.org" target="_blank">National Wildlife Federation</a>, so it seems legit enough. 

Check it out and take control of your junk mail.
