From <i>[Winning the Oil Endgame][1]</i> (free login required):

> The average new U.S. light vehicle in 2003 had 24% more weight,
 93% more horsepower, and 29% faster 0-60-mph time than in 1981, 
 but only 1% more miles per gallon. If 1981 performance had instead stayed 
 constant, light vehicles would have become 33% more efficient</blockquote>

It's not a bad read, but it is 300+ pages of dense work.
