Our goal right now is to make it possible to add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oral arguments and other audio content,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;video content if it's available,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;content from &lt;a href="https://www.recapthelaw.org"&gt;RECAP&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thousands of ninth circuit briefs that Resource.org &lt;a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/ca9/"&gt;has recently scanned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with our current database is that it's not organized in a way that supports linkages between content. So, if we have the oral argument and the opinion from a single case, we have no way of pointing them at each other. Turns out this is a sticky problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution we've come up with is an architecture like the following:
&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/new-schema-design-compact_0.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(we also have &lt;a href="http://owncloud.freelawproject.org/public.php?service=files&amp;amp;t=76ef76ec69488fb72b4d96dba4809339"&gt;a more detailed version&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://owncloud.freelawproject.org/public.php?service=files&amp;amp;t=62510f0282b06948e8c3d3b1e4946ec0"&gt;an editable version&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And eventually, this will also have a Case table above the docket that allows multiple dockets to be associated with a single case. For now though, that's moot, as we don't have anyway of figuring out which dockets go together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stage of this will be to add support for oral arguments, since they make a simple case to work with. Once that's complete the next stage will be either to add the RECAP documents or those from Resource.org. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="urls"&gt;URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is such a big change, we're also taking this opportunity to re-work our URLs. Currently, they look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;court&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numeric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;https:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//www.courtlistener.com/scotus/yjn/roe-v-wade/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A few things bug me about that. First, it doesn't tell you anything about what kind of thing you can expect to see if you click that link. Second, the alpha-numeric ID is kind of lame. It's just a reference to the database primary key for the item, and we should just show that value (in this case, "yjn" means "108713"). To fix both of these issues, the new URLs will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;opinion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numeric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;https:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That should be easier to read and should tell you what type of item you're about to look at. Don't worry, the old URLs will keep working just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the rest of the new URLs will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;oral&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numeric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;docket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numeric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and eventually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numeric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 id="api"&gt;API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect these changes to come with changes to the API, so we'll likely be releasing API version 1.1 that will add suport for dockets and oral arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current version 1.0 should keep working just fine, since we're not changing any of the underlying data, but I expect that it will have some changes to the URLs and things like that. I'll be posting more about this in &lt;a href="http://lists.freelawproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/dev"&gt;the CourtListener dev list.&lt;/a&gt; as the changes become more clear and as we sort out what a fair policy is for the deprecation of old APIs. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="CourtListener"></category><category term="data modeling"></category><category term="database"></category></entry><entry><title>New Tool to Remove Dead Feeds from OPML Files</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2013/06/28/trim-your-dead-feeds/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-28T22:56:37+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2013-06-28:posts/2013/06/28/trim-your-dead-feeds/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since Google Reader's closure is immenent, a lot of folks are looking for 
solutions. One problem I've run into many times throughout the years is that
the feeds I have in Google Reader are largely dead, and there's no way to get
rid of the ones that are no longer updated or simply gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/mlissner/trim-my-feeds/overview"&gt;So I built a tool.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out on BitBucket and give it a whirl. It'll go through an OPML file, 
check all the feeds in it, and make a new file for you that has them cleaned
 out. In my case, it purged about 20% of the feeds I had -- a big improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a simple tool, but look, if your friend hasn't updated their blog in 
two years...they're probably not going to. If the feed is gone, you no longer 
need it cluttering your life. If a feed has been redirected, you should fix 
that in your reader!

It's not that hard, but there are a couple things you need to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't gone through these instructions to make sure they work, but this is roughly what I've done to get my Postgres/Windows/Node/Etherpad working together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install node.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install python&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add PYTHON as an env&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install postgres&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.2\bin to your path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download etherpad-lite with git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the etherpad-lite windows installer per the instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start etherpad-lite&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make sure it works with the dirty DB before getting exotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up postgres&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;npm install pg (will throw an error about msbuild version, but ignore that, the native JS drivers are installed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add a user using pgadmin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add a DB using pgadmin and the user created a second ago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reconfigure to use postgres in the settings.json file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run start.bat to make sure it works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn down the log messages to only ERROR in the settings.json file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://nssm.cc/"&gt;NSSM&lt;/a&gt; to daemonize it, per the instructions &lt;a href="https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/How-to-deploy-Etherpad-Lite-as-a-service"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that NSSM doesn't yet have stdout and stderr redirection built in. Thus, to start the daemon with these working, you have to create a little script like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;ECHO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;OFF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;REM This runs etherpad with stdout and stderr getting redirected to special logs
&lt;span class="k"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; D:\etherpad\etherpad-lite\start.bat &amp;gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;:\etherpad\etherpad-lite\logs\stdout.log &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;:\etherpad\etherpad-lite\logs\stderr.log

The problem was that we're using a lot of XPath queries to scrape various court websites, but there was no tool that could be used to test xpath expressions efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple tools that are quite similar to what I just built: There's one called Xacobeo, Eclipse has one built in, and even Firebug has a tool that does similar. Unfortunately though, these each operate on a different DOM interpretation than the one that lxml builds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the problem I was running into was that while these tools helped, I consistently had the problem that when the HTML got nasty, they'd start falling over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more! Today I built &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/mlissner/lxml-xpath-tester/"&gt;a quick Django app&lt;/a&gt; that can be run locally or on a server. It's quite simple. You input some HTML and an XPath expression, and it will tell you the matches for that expression. It has syntax highlighting, and a few other tricks up its sleeve, but it's pretty basic on the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love to get any feedback I can about this. It's probably still got some bugs, but it's small enough that they should be quite easy to stamp out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I got in touch with the developer of Xacobeo. There's an --html flag that you can pass to it at startup, if that's your intention. If you use that, it indeed uses the same DOM parser that my tool does. Sigh. Affordances are important, especially in a GUI-based tool.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Python"></category><category term="lxml"></category><category term="juriscraper"></category><category term="courtlistener.com"></category></entry><entry><title>My Presentation Proposal for LVI 2012</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2012/03/15/my-presentation-proposal-for-lvi-2012/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-15T20:09:29+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2012-03-15:posts/2012/03/15/my-presentation-proposal-for-lvi-2012/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/lvi2012/"&gt;Law Via the Internet&lt;/a&gt; conference is  celebrating its 20th anniversary
 at Cornell University on October 7-9th. I will be attending, 
 and with any luck, I'll be presenting on the topic proposed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wrangling-court-data-on-a-national-level"&gt;Wrangling Court Data on a National Level&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to case law has recently become easier than ever: By simply visiting 
a court's website it is now possible to find and read thousands of cases 
withou  ever leaving your home. At the same time, there are nearly a hundred
 court websites, many of these websites suffer from poor funding or 
 prioritization, and gaining a higher-level view of the law can be 
 challenging. "&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/mlissner/juriscraper/"&gt;Juriscraper&lt;/a&gt;" is a new project designed to ease these 
 problems for all those that wish to collect these court opinions daily. The
  project is under active development, and we are looking for others to get 
  involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juriscraper is a liberally-licensed open source library that can be picked 
up and used by any organization to scrape the case data from court websites.
 In addition to a simply scraping the websites and extracting metadata from 
 them, Juriscraper has a number of other design goals:   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensibility to support video, oral argument audio, and other media types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for all metadata provided by court websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensibility to support varied geographies and jurisdictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generalized object-oriented architecture with little or no code repetition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardized coding techniques using the latest libraries and standards (Python, xpath, lxml, requests, chardet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple installation, configuration, and API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friendly and transparent to court websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as a number of features:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harmonizatio  of metadata (US, USA, United States of America, 
 etc ? United States; et al, et. al., etc. get eliminated; vs., v, 
 vs ? v.; all dates are Python objects; etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart title-casing of case names (several courts provide case names in 
 uppercase only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sanity checking and sorting of metadata values returned by court websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once implemented, Juriscraper is part of a two-part system. The second part 
is the caller, which uses the API, and which itself solves some interesting 
questions:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are duplicates detected and avoided? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can the impact on court websites be minimized?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can mime type detection be completed successfully so that textual contents can be extracted?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should we do if it is an image-based PDF?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should HTML be tidied?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How often should we check a court website for new content?  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should we do in case of failure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juriscraper is currently deployed by CourtListener.com to scrape all of the 
Federal Appeals courts, and we are slowly adding additional state courts 
over the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been scraping these sites in various ways for several years, 
and Juriscraper is the culmination of what we've learned. We hope that by 
presenting our work at LVI 2012, we will be able to share what we have 
learned and gain additional collaborators in our work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="proposal"></category><category term="presentations"></category><category term="me"></category><category term="lvi2012"></category><category term="juriscraper"></category><category term="courtlistener.com"></category></entry><entry><title>Adding New Fonts to Tesseract 3 OCR Engine</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2012/02/11/adding-new-fonts-to-tesseract-3-ocr-engine/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-11T10:53:30+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2012-02-11:posts/2012/02/11/adding-new-fonts-to-tesseract-3-ocr-engine/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; I've turned off commenting on this article because it was just a bunch of people asking for help and never getting any. If you need help with these instructions, go to Stack Overflow and ask there. If you have corrections to the article, please send them directly to me using the Contact form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/"&gt;Tesseract&lt;/a&gt; is a great and powerful OCR engine, but their &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract3"&gt;instructions for adding a new font&lt;/a&gt; are incredibly long and complicated. At CourtListener we have to handle several unusual &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter"&gt;blackletter fonts&lt;/a&gt;, so we had to go through this process a few times. Below I've explained the process so others may more easily add fonts to their system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process has a few major steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#create-training-docs"&gt;Create training documents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#train-tesseract"&gt;Teach Tesseract about the documents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="create-training-documents"&gt;Create training documents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create training documents, open up MS Word or LibreOffice, paste in the contents of the attached file named 'standard-training-text.txt'. This file contains the training text that is used by Tesseract for the included fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set your line spacing to at least 1.5, and space out the letters by about 1pt. using character spacing. I've attached a sample doc too, if that helps. Set the text to the font you want to use, and save it as font-name.doc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the document as a PDF (call it [lang].font-name.exp0.pdf, with lang being an &lt;a href="http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/iso-639-3_Name_Index_20120203.tab"&gt;ISO-639 three letter abbreviation&lt;/a&gt; for your language), and then use the following command to convert it to a 300dpi tiff (requires imagemagick):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;convert -density 300 -depth 4 lang.font-name.exp0.pdf lang.font-name.exp0.tif&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll now have a good training image called lang.font-name.exp0.tif. If you're adding multiple fonts, or bold, italic or underline, repeat this process multiple times, creating one doc &amp;rarr; pdf &amp;rarr;  tiff per font variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="train-tesseract"&gt;Train Tesseract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to run tesseract over the image(s) we just created, and to see how well it can do with the new font. After it's taken its best shot, we then give it corrections. It'll provide us with a box file, which is just a file containing x,y coordinates of each letter it found along with what letter it thinks it is. So let's see what it can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tesseract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exp0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tiff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exp0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;batch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nochop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;makebox&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You'll now have a file called font-name.exp0.box, and you'll need to open it in a box-file editor. There are a bunch of these &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract3#Box_File_Editors"&gt;on the Tesseract wiki&lt;/a&gt;. The one that works for me (on Ubuntu) is &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/moshpytt/"&gt;moshpytt&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn't support multi-page tiffs. If you need to use a multi-page tiff, see &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/moshpytt/issues/detail?id=2"&gt;the issue on the topic&lt;/a&gt; for tips. Once you've opened it, go through &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; letter, and make sure it was detected correctly. If a letter was skipped, add it as a row to the box file. Similarly, if two letters were detected as one, break them up into two lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that's done, you feed the box file back into tesseract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tesseract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eng&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exp0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eng&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nobatch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;train&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stderr&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to detect the Character set used in all your box files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unicharset_extractor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When that's complete, you need to create a &lt;code&gt;font_properties&lt;/code&gt; file. It should list every font you're training, one per line, and identify whether it has the following characteristics: &amp;lt;fontname&amp;gt; &amp;lt;italic&amp;gt; &amp;lt;bold&amp;gt; &amp;lt;fixed&amp;gt; &amp;lt;serif&amp;gt; &amp;lt;fraktur&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for example, if you use the standard training data, you might end up with a file like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;eng.arial.box 0 0 0 0 0
eng.arialbd.box 0 1 0 0 0
eng.arialbi.box 1 1 0 0 0

eng.verdanai.box 1 0 0 0 0

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that this is the standard font_properties file that should be supplied with Tesseract and I've added the two bold rows for the blackletter fonts I'm training. You can also see which fonts are included out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're getting near the end. Next, create the clustering data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mftraining -F font_properties -U unicharset -O lang.unicharset *.tr 
cntraining *.tr
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract3#Dictionary_Data_(Optional)"&gt;create a wordlist&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract3#The_last_file_(unicharambigs)"&gt;unicharambigs file&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't plan on doing that, the last step is to combine the various files we've created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, rename each of the language files (normproto, Microfeat, inttemp, pffmtable) to have your lang prefix, and run (mind the dot at the end):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;combine_tessdata&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will create all the data files you need, and you just need to move them to the correct place on your OS. On Ubuntu, I was able to move them to;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eng&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;traineddata&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tessdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This information doesn't seem to exist anywhere else on the Internet, so below are our findings, starting with the big guys, and moving towards more obscure or foreign search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="google-bing"&gt;Google, Bing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google (known as Googlebot) and Bing (known as Bingbot) support the x-robots-tag header and the robots HTML tag. Here's &lt;a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=79812"&gt;Google's page&lt;/a&gt; on the topic. And &lt;a href="http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/webmaster/archive/2009/08/21/prevent-a-bot-from-getting-lost-in-space-sem-101.aspx"&gt;here's Bing's&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/webmaster/archive/2009/11/04/msnbot-1-1-is-retired.aspx"&gt;msnbot is retired&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="yahoo-aol"&gt;Yahoo, AOL&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo!'s search engine is provided by Bing. AOL's is provided by Google. These are easy ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="ask-yandex-nutch"&gt;Ask, Yandex, Nutch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask (known as teoma), and Yandex (Russia's search engine, known as yandex), support the robots meta tag, but do not appear to support the x-robots-tag. Ask's page on the topic &lt;a href="http://www.ask.com/staticcontent/about/helpcenter/about_helpcenter_webmaster#5"&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;, and Yandex's &lt;a href="http://help.yandex.com/webmaster/?id=1113833"&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;. The popular open source crawler, &lt;a href="http://nutch.apache.org/"&gt;Nutch&lt;/a&gt;, also &lt;a href="http://nutch.sourceforge.net/docs/en/bot.html"&gt;supports the robots HTML tag&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/Support-for-x-robots-tag-td3678606.html"&gt;not the x-robots-tag header&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; Newer versions of Nutch now support x-robots-tag!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="the-internet-archive-alexa"&gt;The Internet Archive, Alexa&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Archive uses Alexa's crawler, which is known as ia_archiver. This crawler does not seem to support either the HTML robots meta tag nor the x-robots-tag HTTP header. Their page on the subject &lt;a href="http://www.alexa.com/help/webmasters"&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;. I have requested more information from them, and will update this page if I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="duckduckgo-blekko-baidu"&gt;Duckduckgo, Blekko, Baidu&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duckduckgo and Blekko do not support either the robots meta tag nor the x-robots-tag header, per emails I've had with each of them. I also requested information from Baidu, but their response totally ignored my question and was in Chinese. They do have some information &lt;a href="http://wenku.baidu.com/view/ec4457d4b14e852458fb5793.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but it does not seem to provide any information on the noindex value for the robots tag. In any case, the only way to block these crawlers seems to be via a robots.txt file.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="x-robots-tag"></category><category term="search"></category><category term="robots"></category><category term="privacy"></category></entry><entry><title>Android Icons from Ice Cream Sandwich</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2012/01/12/android-icons-from-ice-cream-sandwich/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-12T18:38:34+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2012-01-12:posts/2012/01/12/android-icons-from-ice-cream-sandwich/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those that are looking for the stock Android icons that come with the platform, I just pulled them together, and put them in a zip for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, progress has been slower than I'd like due to the limitations of the Solr frameworks I've been using. There are a number of competing frameworks available, each with its own strengths and pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I've tried two of the popular ones, &lt;a href="http://haystacksearch.org/"&gt;Haystack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://opensource.timetric.com/sunburnt/index.html"&gt;Sunburnt&lt;/a&gt;. I'm pretty impressed by both, but today's blog post is to outline the problems I'm having with these frameworks so that others that are faced with choosing one might be better informed. The difference between these frameworks is vast. Haystack aims to solve all of your integration needs, while Sunburnt is a fairly lightweight wrapper around Solr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CourtListener's needs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CourtListener, we have some big goals for the new search version. At its core, it's essentially a search-powered site, so we have some big needs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/09/best-practices-for-designing-faceted-search-filters.php"&gt;Parallel Faceted Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex boolean searches supported by Solr's eDisMax syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snippets below search results and in emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard search stuff: field-level boosting, result and facet counts, field-level searching, result pagination, performance, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're currently using &lt;a href="http://sphinxsearch.com"&gt;Sphinx Search&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://github.com/dcramer/django-sphinx"&gt;django-sphinx&lt;/a&gt;, which does a fine job, but it has some problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;django-sphinx hasn't been maintained in years, and requires patching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;django-sphinx doesn't support snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sphinx doesn't (yet) support real time indexing (though it's in beta, I believe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sphinx doesn't have the community and features that Solr does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfamiliar syntax for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, these problems aren't too difficult, but in combination, they make for a poor user experience. The last point is a real deal breaker, since most users are accustomed to making queries like [ site:google.com ], which works for Solr and Google, but not for Sphinx. In Sphinx, your query is [ @site(google.com) ]. While we could do post processing of the user's query to convert it to Google/Solr-style syntax, it's unreliable and prone to failing in corner cases. Parsing queries is hard. More on this in a moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let's try Haystack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In switching from Sphinx, I first tried Haystack as a solution, since it has excellent documentation and seems to be the most popular solution. I spent about two weeks learning about it and getting it in place, but ultimately, I gave up on it because I found that I was subclassing it everywhere. Haystack is a good solution, to be sure, but I found that I was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subclassing the FacetView so it could support parallel facet counts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subclassing the FacetForm for another feature I needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subclassing the Solr backend so it could support Solr's highlighting syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further subclassing the Solr backend so it can support additional Solr parameters that aren't built in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on that third point for the better part of a day before deciding that Haystack wasn't for me. Rather than spending my time working on the search needs of CourtListener, I was spending most of it hacking on Haystack, and trying to understand the way it fits together. It's not unreasonably complex, but there is a LOT of documentation, and a lot of complexity that I don't need (such as the ability to switch search backends). Instead of a big solution that allows me to subclass whatever I need (which is good), I needed a lighter-weight solution that was more nimble, and which allowed me to interact with Solr in a more direct way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enter Sunburnt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunburnt is a lightweight solution that is everything that Haystack isn't. From the moment it's installed, you can start making queries without configuring Django to use it, and without really knowing much else. Its documentation is a single page, which is actually a big relief after coming from Haystack. But Sunburnt has a major problem in its design: It doesn't support just sending queries to Solr. The expectation in Sunburnt is that each system using it does post-processing on the user's query, and then submits the query to Sunburnt in stages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if a user searches for "foo bar", rather than just passing that to Sunburnt, you have to split on the white space, then pass: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;si&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At first you think, "OK, I can do that - just split on white space, no big deal." Then you start thinking about the &lt;a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_4_0/queryparsersyntax.html#Escaping%20Special%20Characters"&gt;other syntax&lt;/a&gt; that Solr supports, and you realize that you have a real problem if you have to split up queries appropriately. Trust me when I say that you don't want to be thinking about how to send a query like this one to Sunburnt: [ foo bar "jakarta apache"~10 ]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of Sunburnt will point out that there's a workaround for this problem. You can use &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;si&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;jakarta apache&amp;quot;~10&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That works, to a point, but that syntax isn't supported on facets, so your facet counts won't have the same counts as your results. And so, Sunburnt, though powerful and lightweight, fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What now?&lt;/h3&gt;

At CourtListener, for example, we make URLs with ID numbers in them that are formed by converting an ID number to letters (so a &amp;rarr; 1, b &amp;rarr; 2, 27 &amp;rarr; A, etc). Higher numbers create longer strings of letters, so over time, this creates curse words in the URL. Currently, the site is only has a few four letter strings, but I will rue the day when any of the &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Seven_dirty_words" target="_blank"&gt;seven dirty words&lt;/a&gt; is being shown to users on my site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many lists of curse words on the web, but none that is maintained or curated. Having that alone would be a useful project. What would make it better would be libraries in popular programming languages that efficiently told you if a string contained a curse word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next feature would be to add additional languages, and then to add words like pen1s, which aren't normally curse words, but are certainly words you'd want to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'd be a pretty simple project, so I may just go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

This change meant that links that were previously like this:&lt;blockquote&gt;http://courtlistener.com/scotus/Wong-v.-Smith/&lt;/blockquote&gt;Are now like this:&lt;blockquote&gt;http://courtlistener.com/scotus/&lt;strong&gt;V5o&lt;/strong&gt;/wong-v-smith/&lt;/blockquote&gt;Most of the old links should continue to work, but using the new links should be much faster and more reliable. The major difference between the two is the ID number, which is encoded as a set of numbers (in this case &lt;em&gt;V5o&lt;/em&gt;). This ID corresponds directly with the ID number in our database, aiding us greatly in serving up cases quickly and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time as this change, we added social networking links to all of our case pages to make them easier to share with friends and colleagues. These links use our new tiny domain, &lt;em&gt;http://crt.li/&lt;/em&gt;, and should thus be ideal for websites like Twitter or Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few months we will be getting a major new server, and will be migrating our data to it. This will allow us to serve more data, and&amp;mdash;drum roll please&amp;mdash;will allow us to begin serving audio content on the site. That's right, in the next few months, we will begin getting oral arguments from the circuit courts, and will be serving it directly to you on the case pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have plans to revisit our search interface in order to add date filtering and query building so look for that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

I considered drawing it out by hand with a charting program, but the idea of updating it whenever somebody moved in or out seemed daunting, and I decided that the best thing would be to make a program that could generate a chart from XML. My new job at &lt;a href="http://recommind.com"&gt;Recommind&lt;/a&gt; requires that I learn and use XSLT, so I took the opportunity to write an XSLT script that converts the XML data to HTML, Javascript and SVG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final product looks something like this (anonymized with Presidential info for good measure):
&lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/swimlanes/dummy.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/swimlane-screenshot.png" alt="Swimlane diagram demo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(click through for complete demo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the technically inclined: The program is an XSLT script, which converts the XML into HTML and Javascript. The Javascript is then interpreted by the &lt;a href="http://raphaeljs.com/"&gt;Raphael library&lt;/a&gt;, which finally generates the SVG you see. It's overly complex, but it was a fun mis-mash of technologies to play with and the point was learning new things as much as anything.&lt;/p&gt;

With enough time, I could figure out every bug that I've filed, every comment I've posted, every patch that I've submitted (there aren't many), and every &lt;em&gt;contribution&lt;/em&gt; I've made. But it would take me a LOT of effort, and after not too long, I'd be knee deep in records and notes of where I had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people that contribute and work on such projects, knowing these kinds of things is valuable in forming an online reputation. This lets people know whether you are a helpful person, what you find interesting, and where your expertise may be. If you're looking for work in such a field, it's great to be able to point to a record of contribution, and say, "Yes, I am interested in this field, and I have a track record to prove it." It creates competition amongst contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since the current eco-system of online contribution is so diversified, it becomes very challenging to determine a person's online reputation. Some sites do admirable work building in algorithms to calculate the value of users, and this is good. But if you're a person that has been interested in many applications, or that has been working on open-source projects for a long time, it's more likely than not that such systems fall short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we need is an aggregated, centralized system that uses public APIs to build global "meta"-reputations.&lt;/strong&gt; This is likely not that hard, since many of the more-common systems for tracking user contributions already have APIs and RSS feeds for so many things. I'm sure it's more complicated than simply plugging into an API, but creating such a system might not be that hard, and would create great value for the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="user contribution"></category><category term="reputational system"></category><category term="Project idea"></category><category term="open source"></category><category term="aggregation"></category></entry><entry><title>Announcing CourtListener.com</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/05/01/announcing-courtlistener/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-01T20:08:16+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2010-05-01:posts/2010/05/01/announcing-courtlistener/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm elated to announce today that I am officially taking the ropes of my final project and letting it loose into the wild. It's been seven months since development on it officially started and finally, the beta version is done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't been following along, the &lt;a href="http://courtlistener.com"&gt;project itself&lt;/a&gt; is an open source legal research tool which allows anybody to keep up to date with federal precedents as they are set by the 13 Federal Circuit courts. Right now, it has &lt;a href="http://courtlistener.com/coverage/"&gt;more than 130,000 documents in its corpus&lt;/a&gt;, including almost all of the Supreme Court record dating back to 1754. Every day it downloads the latest documents within about a half hour of when each court publishes them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we've focused on while building the site has making it as useful as possible for as many people as possible. Since not everybody likes getting updates in their inbox, we've also tied the search engine in with an Atom feed generator so that you can search for whatever you want, and then follow updates in your feed reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything we've built uses a powerful boolean search engine on the backend. At present, there are &lt;a href="http://courtlistener.com/search/advanced-techniques/"&gt;a ton of boolean connectors&lt;/a&gt; that you can use on our site to search our corpus or create alerts and feeds. Unlike full text search that most people are familiar with, boolean search allows incredibly complex queries, such as every document mentioning Attorney General Holder that is published in the Third Circuit of Appeals (&lt;a href="http://courtlistener.com/search/results/?q=%40court+ca3+%40doctext+holder&amp;search="&gt;@court ca3 @doctext holder&lt;/a&gt;), or perhaps every document that mentions "Roe" and "Wade" within ten words of each other (&lt;a href="http://courtlistener.com/search/results/?q=%40doctext+%22roe+wade%22~10&amp;search="&gt;@doctext "roe wade"~10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not all. Because we also want you to be able to use this efficiently during your day-to-day searching, we've built an &lt;a href="http://courtlistener.com/tools/"&gt;add-on that will work in most browsers&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to search CourtListener.com without first going to our homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also browse all of documents in our corpus, or you can go to the details page for an opinion, where you can read the text of its body without having to download a PDF and crank up Adobe Acrobat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, this project has been designed as an open source project, so if you're looking for something to contribute to, look no further. We have a very active &lt;a href="http://bitbucket.org/mlissner/legal-current-awareness/issues?status=new&amp;status=open"&gt;bug list&lt;/a&gt; where you can dip your toes in, or if you prefer something meatier, we can cook something up specifically for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've greatly enjoyed working on this project so far, and I'd love to get more people using it, working on it, and recommending it to their friends. We're already planning version 1.0, so drop me a line if you're interested in helping out, otherwise, &lt;a href="http://courtlistener.com"&gt;go check it out already&lt;/a&gt;, and see all that it has to offer!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Final Project"></category><category term="courtlistener.com"></category><category term="announcements"></category></entry><entry><title>In consideration of Apple</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/05/01/in-consideration-of-apple/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-01T17:56:08+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2010-05-01:posts/2010/05/01/in-consideration-of-apple/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's some news circulating today that Steve Jobs &lt;a href="http://hugoroy.eu/jobs-os.php" target="_blank"&gt;emailed an intern at the Free Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and informed him that:&lt;blockquote&gt;A patent pool is being assembled to go after Theora and other "open source" codecs now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't seem too surprising, and the email seems pretty legit, so I was pretty frustrated to see that Apple may be doing this. I've been getting a reputation among my friends for demonizing Apple, so I thought I'd take a moment and lay down some of the reasons that they've gotten the brunt of my technology-related ire. A lot of people see them as a great and open company with a great product, but more and more, they are locking in users, and creating products and technologies that are just as bad, if not worse than, the lock-in technologies that Microsoft used back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a short list of the things that Apple has recently done that has been for the worse for technological progress and for the worse for users. I write this not just to make a list, but to point out that Apple has become just as bad as the other companies before them. I fully admit, their hardware is great, but at this point, there can be little doubt that they are doing bad for technology and hindering the forward motion of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power cord.&lt;/strong&gt; As I understand it, Apple invented (or at least patented) the really cool magnet on a cord thing. It would be great if this were offered on all laptops, but because of their patent, only Apple laptops have this feature. This is an example of a company using a patent in a way that only helps their customers. But what's worse is that because they have this patent, they can mark up the prices of their replacement cords. They're nice, but are they really $80 nice? Normally, you could get a replacement cord from anybody for your laptop, but because of the patent, you have to buy theirs. For $80.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The requirement to own a Mac to develop for a Mac.&lt;/strong&gt;To develop for a Mac, you have to use XCode, and to use XCode, you have to have a Mac. This is another case of Apple finding a way to lock in its customers and developers. No other explanation of this that I know of holds water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo, an iPhone and police.&lt;/strong&gt; It appears that Apple has sent police after a blogger that purchased a lost v4 iPhone. The verdict is not yet in as to whether the blogger's actions were legal or not, but he did have his house searched, and all of his computers taken by the police. All of this because he wrote a story about an iPhone that wasn't yet released. He was able to do this because an Apple employee goofed by leaving the phone at a bar, so it seems like the company should simply chalk it up to their mistake and move on. Instead, they send police.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPod lock-in, lack of compatibility, etc.&lt;/strong&gt; iPods are the worst when it comes to using them as general purpose music players. You want to move your music from one computer to another with an iPod? Oooh...I don't know if you can do that. You want to use USB cable with that? Oh, no, we have a /special/ cable for that. You want to dump your MP3s onto the device outside of iTunes? No, no, no, you have to use iTunes or else it won't work. Etc. Anybody who has owned an iPod for any length of time knows the pains of which I speak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad VGA is a private API.&lt;/strong&gt; It appears that in order to have an application on the iPad use an external monitor or projector, you have to get Apple's permission first, because the VGA API is not public. This means that Apple has a monopoly on which applications can be used in this way. The result: More lock in for Apple, and less power and utility for users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psystar and Palm.&lt;/strong&gt; Both of these companies tried to leverage the Apple platform to their advantage. Both were hit hard when Apple locked them out. Both of these outcomes were bad for consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music store lock-in.&lt;/strong&gt; I don't know if they're only selling MP3s now or if they are still doing DRMed music, but their DRMed music has been a pain for a number of people I know, since it can only be played through iTunes. Again, this creates more lock in, since users can't take their music with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suing HTC over multitouch.&lt;/strong&gt; Apple is now suing HTC over their use of Apple's patented multitouch interface technique. This is another case of Apple using a software patent for the worse. Which would you prefer: only Apple having multitouch phones/computers, or every company making them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't follow Apple news as closely as a number of people I know, so I'm interested in hearing other people's thoughts about all this. From my perspective, Apple has become a very secretive company that is incredibly willing to sue and patent. It doesn't seem like they want to help people or innovate so much any more.

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tablename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;marked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;crashed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;automatic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repair&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a bad warning to get, and running df on the server confirms that indeed my hard drive is full. Fixing this is a matter of doing some minor MySQL hacking to clean up all the tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mysql -u&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;drupalusername&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; -p
&amp;gt; use drupal_DB_name;
&amp;gt; check table tablename;
&amp;gt; repair table tablename;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, simply iterate this for each broken table reported by cron.php, and you will soon have a repaired DB.

Last night I finally finished the last of them, so today I'm moving on to the design of the site. Design is always much better when people work in a team, so I'm putting these designs here so others can look at them and give me feedback. Please, please do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I've sketched out four of the major pages that the site will have. A user's will begin using the site on its homepage. Here, they will be given few options. Basically, they can login, register for an account, make a search, or read one of the ancillary pages such as the "About" or "Privacy" page:
&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/DSC02180%20(Modified).800x600.preview.JPG"&gt;
Also, note the advanced button under the search field. When this is clicked, it expands to show the advanced search queries that the site will support, as you can see on the next page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people are logged in, their homepage becomes the "Create new alert page," which you can see below. For now, this allows users to create very complicated queries by hand. In the future, it would be nice to build their queries for them. By default, the advanced section will be collapsed, but in the wire frame, I sketched it out. Also, if users click on "More details," (in the bottom-right of the "Advanced" box) they can get explanations and examples of all the connectors shown.
&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/DSC02183%20(Modified).800x600.preview.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that page, they would normally be redirected to their settings page, where their alerts are listed. Here, they can edit and see their alerts.
&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/DSC02185%20(Modified).800x600.preview.JPG"&gt;
Clicking the "Edit" button takes a user back to the "create alert" page, except that it will be pre-filled with the alert they're trying to edit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, users can also edit their profile by clicking on the settings link on the top of every page . This page isn't too special, though it does have a couple unusual features, such as the bar memberships the user is a part of and whether they prefer HTML or plain text emails (not shown in the below version - sorry).
&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/DSC02184%20(Modified).800x600.preview.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it for now. I'd LOVE any feedback anybody has on these. Typing this up, I've already come across a couple problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users currently get to their alerts by clicking settings - that ain't intuitive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The about page is pretty hard to find. It may need more emphasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are more problems I'm not seeing. That's why I need your help. What am I missing? What should I change? What's stupid? What's outmoded?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="wire frame"></category><category term="Final Project"></category><category term="Design"></category></entry><entry><title>Using Revision Control on a Django Project Without Revealing Your Passwords</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/02/24/using-revision-control-on-a-django-project-without-revealing-your-passwords/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-02-24T17:15:54+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2010-02-24:posts/2010/02/24/using-revision-control-on-a-django-project-without-revealing-your-passwords/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post today, since this took me way too long to figure out. If you have a django project that you want to share without sharing the private bits of settings.py, there is an easy way to do this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried for a while to to set up mercurial hooks that would strip out my passwords before each commit, and then place them back after each commit, thus avoiding uploading them publicly. This does not work however because all of the mercurial hooks happen after snapshots of the modified files have been made. So you can edit the files using a hook, but your edits will only go into effect upon the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; check in. Clearly, this will not do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution that I tried was the mercurial &lt;a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/KeywordExtension" target="_blank"&gt;keyword extension&lt;/a&gt;. This could work, but ultimately it does not because you have to remember to run it before and after each commit &amp;mdash; something I know I'd forget sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; work is to split up your settings.py file into multiple pieces such that there is a private file and a public file. I followed the instructions &lt;a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/SplitSettings#UsingalistofconffilesTransifex" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with the resulting code looking being checked in &lt;a href="http://bitbucket.org/mlissner/legal-current-awareness/src/fa5cc7fb9c0b/alert/settings.py" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bitbucket.org/mlissner/legal-current-awareness/src/fa5cc7fb9c0b/alert/settings/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a file called "20-private.conf" which is not uploaded publicly, and which contains all the private bits of code that would normally be found in settings.py. Thus, all of my settings can be found my django, but I do not have to share my private ones.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="settings.py"></category><category term="revision control"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="mercurial"></category><category term="django"></category><category term="Final Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Converting PDF Files to HTML</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/02/06/converting-pdf-files-to-html/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-02-06T15:03:18+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2010-02-06:posts/2010/02/06/converting-pdf-files-to-html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my final project, we are considering posting court cases on our site, and so I did some work today analyzing how best to convert the PDF files the courts give us to HTML that people can actually use. I looked briefly at google docs, since it has an amazing tool that converts PDF files to something resembling text, but short of spending a few days hacking the site, I couldn't figure out any easy way to leverage their technology in any sort of automated way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two tools I have looked at today are &lt;a href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/" target="_blank"&gt;pdftotext&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pdftohtml.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"&gt;pdftohtml&lt;/a&gt;, which, not surprisingly, do what their names claim they do. Since we're going to be pulling cases from the 13 federal circuit courts, I wanted to figure out which method works best for which court, and which method will provide us with the most generalizable solution across whatever PDF a court may crank out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short version is that the best option seems to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;pdftotext -htmlmeta -layout -enc &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;UTF-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; yourfile.pdf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This creates an html file with the text of the case laid out best as possible, some basic html meta data applied, and the UTF-8 encoding applied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before coming to this conclusion though, I looked at two settings that pdftohtml has. With the -c argument, it can generate a 'complex' HTML document that closely resembles that of the original. Without the -c argument, it will create a more simple document. Although the complex documents are rather impressive in appearance, they're abysmal when it comes to the quality of the HTML code that is generated. For an example, look at the source code for this &lt;a href="/archive/shared/pdf-to-html-test/pdftohtml-complex-noframes-noimages-2ndCircuit-08-6301-cv_opn.html"&gt;this file&lt;/a&gt;. If, on the other hand, the -c argument is not run, and the simple documents are generated, the appearance of the final product is worse than the simple text documents that are created by pdftotext. Check out &lt;a href="/archive/shared/pdf-to-html-test/pdftohtml-simple-noframes-noimages-2ndCircuit-08-6301-cv_opn.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thoroughness, here is a table containing the results from this test.
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Court&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;pdftotext&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;pdftohtml complex&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;pdftotext simple&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Original PDF&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan="4" align="center"&gt;The first circuit publishes in HTML Format by default&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A caveat regarding pdftotext:&lt;/strong&gt; This library is developed by a company called &lt;a href="http://www.glyphandcog.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Glyph &amp;amp; Cog&lt;/a&gt;. Although the code is open source, I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to file a bug against it. This doesn't particularly bode well for using something as a dependency. On the flip side, Glyph &amp;amp; Cog is happy to provide support for the product.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pdftotext"></category><category term="pdftohtml"></category><category term="pdf"></category><category term="Final Project"></category><category term="courtlistener.com"></category></entry><entry><title>New Server!</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/01/26/new-server/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-01-26T20:22:42+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2010-01-26:posts/2010/01/26/new-server/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href="/blog/drupal-is-go"&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; this blog more than two years ago, it was an experiment in blogging and an experiment in running my own server. At this point, it's safe to say that the results of the experiment are in. While running my own server out of my attic has been an enlightening experience, teaching me about everything from DNS to PHP, ultimately, I have come to the conclusion that if I want a reliable, powerful and secure sever, running it myself is not the way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that light, today I've transferred this website over to the people at &lt;a href="http://slicehost.com" target="_blank"&gt;slicehost&lt;/a&gt;. This will give me (almost) all the freedom of running the server myself, and should relieve some of the headaches I've had for the past couple of years when it came to power outages, comcast and AT&amp;amp;T outages, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving the site over has been a bit complicated, so if you see anything weird, let me know via the &lt;a href="/contact"&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; link, which should work as of now. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="slicehost"></category><category term="drupal"></category></entry><entry><title>How to Protect Your Open Source Code from Theft and a Mercurial Hook to Help</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/01/15/how-to-protect-your-open-source-code-from-theft-and-a-mercurial-hook-to-help/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-01-15T10:27:18+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2010-01-15:posts/2010/01/15/how-to-protect-your-open-source-code-from-theft-and-a-mercurial-hook-to-help/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated, 2010-01-24:&lt;/strong&gt; Some edits regarding the Affero license (thanks to Brian at &lt;a href="http://cyberlawcases.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://cyberlawcases.com&lt;/a&gt; for the corrections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've finally begun doing some of the actual coding for &lt;a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2010/judicialnlp" target="_blank"&gt;my final project&lt;/a&gt; so the time has come to set up &lt;a href="http://bitbucket.org/mlissner/legal-current-awareness/" target="_blank"&gt;a mercurial repository&lt;/a&gt; to hold the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we complete our project, we will have built a free product that competes with some of the core functionality of both LexisNexis and Westlaw, so something we wanted to do was make sure they couldn't steal our code, enhance their product and thus moot ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we're using the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html" target="_blank"&gt;GNU Affero General Public License v3&lt;/a&gt;, which allows people to take our code for free, but requires that they publicly share any modifications that they make to the code. The normal GNU General Public License allows the code to be used at no cost, but only requires that changes to the code be shared with the public if one distributes the changed version to the public. With a server-based project, like ours, one could operate modified versions of the code without ever having a need to distribute any of the software to the public. This loophole is closed by the Affero license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to license our work, we must be its copyright holder. This is easy enough, since we get copyright instantly in the U.S., but, as has been demonstrated in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobsen_v._Katzer" target="_blank"&gt;Jacobsen v. Katzer&lt;/a&gt;, in order to seek remedies for copyright violations, we would have to register everything we made with the copyright office. This &lt;a href="http://www.copyright.gov/docs/fees.html" target="_blank"&gt;costs $35&lt;/a&gt; per registration, and with open source software, it's not clear whether each and every version needs to be registered or just major releases, or what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is too onerous to be practical, an additional approach to protecting our works is useful, and in the DMCA (&lt;a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#506" target="_blank"&gt;17 U.S.C. § 506(d)&lt;/a&gt;), remedies are provided for the "fraudulent removal of copyright notice." Although these do not (in any way) match the protections provided by normal copyright registration, they are a useful place to begin. Thus, if we place a copyright notice into each file of our code, those using our code must either risk violating the DMCA by removing these notices, or leave our copyright information intact. (Placing such notices in each file is also &lt;a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-howto.html" target="_blank"&gt;the recommendation&lt;/a&gt; of the Free Software Foundation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To place our information into each and every file of code that we upload publicly, I wrote a short mercurial hook that  adds copyright and licensing information it to the top of every file that is modified or added to the repository. To use the script, simply make it executable, place it in the .hg directory of your project, and add the following lines to .hg/hgrc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[hooks]
pretxncommit = .hg/checklicense.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A couple of things I should note about this script is that it currently only checks for java and python files, and that it requires files called java_license.txt and python_license.txt to be in the root of your repository. It should be fairly easy to modify though to fit your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="mercurial"></category><category term="hook"></category><category term="Final Project"></category><category term="DMCA"></category><category term="copyright"></category><category term="Affero GPLv3"></category><category term="courtlistener.com"></category></entry><entry><title>Script to Rid Thyself of Autocomplete = Off in Firefox</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/12/15/script-to-rid-thyself-of-autocomplete-in-firefox/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-12-15T17:41:27+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-12-15:posts/2009/12/15/script-to-rid-thyself-of-autocomplete-in-firefox/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I took some time today and wrote up a script that can be run to eliminate autocomplete=off in Firefox. It basically does the same thing as is described &lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/blog/rid-thyself-of-autocomplete-in-firefox"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but it automates it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script can be run with one of five arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can choose to use find (--find) or locate (--locate) to find the files that need to be changed on your system;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can dictate the location of the file if you want to modify a specific one or know exactly where it's located (--dictate);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can choose to use the Ubuntu default location (--default); or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can print the help information (--help)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the program is run, it will make a back up, and modify it the original versions of the file. Once that's complete, all you have to do is restart Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been pointed out to me by some security folks that removing autocomplete's functionality from the browser might not be the best thing, since it will allow you to save your passwords in the browser. There's some truth to that: Anything that's on your computer can be hacked. So, if you're going to use this script, use it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the code. I've attached it to this message as well. Any bugs or comments are greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# a simple script to destroy autocomplete in linux installations.&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c"&gt;##############&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# We begin with our functions, it&amp;#39;s not efficient, but it works&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;##############&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# a function to print the help message.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;printHelp &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
cat &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;NAME&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;    autocompleteDestroyer.sh&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;SYNOPSIS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;    autocompleteDestroyer.sh [ --find | --default | --help | --locate | --dictate ]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;    This program will find the nsLoginManager.js file on your computer, and will fix it so that autocomplete is disabled in your installation of Firefox. Since this program will be altering your installation of Firefox, it will require your root password.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;    --help     Print this help file&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;    --default  Attempt to use the default location of the files (/usr/lib/xulrunner*/components/nsLoginManager.js)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;    --locate   Use the locate database, if installed, to find the files. This will only find the files that were added before the last time the locate database was updated (which is typically once a day). It is faster than the --find option, but might not find all versions.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;    --find     Use the find command to locate the nsLoginManager.js files. This will search in /usr/lib by default. Edit the script if you would like to change this. This is the slowest, but most thorough option.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;    --dictate  Allows input of a known location.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;EXIT STATUS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;    autocompleteDestroyer.sh exists with a status of 0 if it encounters no problems. An exit status of 1 means incorrect usage. An exit status of 2 indicates it was unable to find your files. An exit status of 3 indicates the user terminated the program. An exit status of 4 means it encountered problems editing your file.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2010-03-08:&lt;/strong&gt;Added an image at drop.io&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2010-01-28:&lt;/strong&gt; Added an image at Orkut.com&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Update 2, 2010-01-28:&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/privacyroundtables/index.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;the FTC round table&lt;/a&gt; today, Facebook's director of public policy, Tim Sparapani, claimed that information deleted from Facebook cannot be retrieved even by Facebook staff, because it is almost instantly deleted. I informed him this was not true in the case of pictures, and he said he would look into it. Will update this post when/if I hear more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine an embarrassing photo of you is placed online by one of your friends. You ask them to take it down, and they do. Now, imagine that your enemy had gotten a link to that photo, and had posted it to their blog. You'd hope that your friend taking the photo down would in fact delete the photo, but I'm sorry to say that isn't always the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/07/are-those-photos-really-deleted-from-facebook-think-twice.ars" target="_blank"&gt;Jacqui Cheng's article&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to test some of the more popular online services for photo hosting to see what happens when you "delete" a photo from their site. On &lt;strong&gt;November 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2009&lt;/strong&gt;, I uploaded and then deleted the following image of a black box with white text to Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, MySpace, Photobucket, Shutterfly, Twitpic and WalMart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/PostedAndDeleted.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look below, if you can see the black box for a site, that means that it was not truly deleted and is still live. You can verify this by clicking on the image. This is checked each time this page is loaded, so the information is constantly verified. If the image has been deleted, you will see the date that it was deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons why photo services might be lazy about properly removing images from their site, but until they have proper deletion mechanisms, we should all think twice about what we upload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's a service that is not shown here that you'd like to see, please &lt;a href="/contact"&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;. And now, without further ado, I present, the ongoing results of the test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Facebook:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file was properly deleted from their server as of at least May 27, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Flickr:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ED: Flickr began showing the following message approximately an hour after the image was "deleted."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're at all like me, you use a password manager to keep track of all your passwords, and it works great. Most of the time. Except sometimes, it doesn't work, and you're confused why. Well, more often than not, it's because your password manager has been blocked by the web page you're viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look closely at the code of the page, somewhere in it, you'll probably find something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;button&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;login&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;login&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;autocomplete=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;off&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That autocomplete parameter that you see at the end there? Yeah, that's the one that's blocking your password manager. So we must block it, so it doesn't block us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a couple approaches to this, but probably the best is to disable Firefox's ability to interpret autocomplete. The way to do this on Linux is to browse to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xulrunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.9.1.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nsLoginManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And in Windows, I believe it's at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;C:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Program&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mozilla&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Firefox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nsLoginManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once you've found that file, open it in an editor, and find the section that has isAutoCompleteDisabled, and make it look like this (so it will always return FALSE):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt; * _isAutoCompleteDisabled&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt; *&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt; * Returns true if the page requests autocomplete be disabled for the&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt; * specified form input.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt; */&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;_isAutocompleteDisabled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//        if (element &amp;amp;&amp;amp; element.hasAttribute(&amp;quot;autocomplete&amp;quot;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//            element.getAttribute(&amp;quot;autocomplete&amp;quot;).toLowerCase() == &amp;quot;off&amp;quot;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//            return true;&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once that's done, save the file, restart Firefox and you're all set.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="firefox"></category><category term="frustration"></category><category term="autocomplete"></category></entry><entry><title>Script to Clean Up F-Spot Database</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/10/14/script-to-cleanup-fspot-database/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-10-14T00:30:12+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-10-14:posts/2009/10/14/script-to-cleanup-fspot-database/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the more popular photo management applications for Linux is f-spot, but unfortunately it has a rather glaring bug. It uses a sqlite3 database internally to track which pictures you've imported into it, what tags they have, etc. However, if you delete, move or rename any of the files that f-spot is tracking, the next time you browse to that photo within f-spot, it will crash the program. It's annoying, and there's no particularly easy way to deal with it...until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script below (and attached) simply iterates through all of the photos that are in f-spot's database, and checks to see if those photos exist on your hard drive. If you run it in demo-mode, it will show you which files look problematic, and if you run it in normal mode, it will delete those database entries so that your database is cleaned up (but not before backing up your database, just in case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my very limited testing, it works very well, any additional feedback or bug reporting is more than welcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# A script to find missing files in the f-spot database, and then delete them.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# At present these files crash f-spot. It&amp;#39;s frustrating as all hell.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the f-spot database cleaner. All the usual disclaimers apply, as you might imagine.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;What would you like to do: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;  1) Run in demo-mode &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;  2) Clean up your f-spot database&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;  3) Quit&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt; -p &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Your choice: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; choice

&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$choice&lt;/span&gt; in 
    1&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;demomode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;;;

This seems like a standard thing to check for, but even in the &lt;a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/3.0b4/" target="_blank"&gt;latest release&lt;/a&gt;, this still hasn't &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129393" target="_blank"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45946" target="_blank"&gt;fixed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was really starting to get out of control for me, so I did some thinking today about how to fix it, and finally came up with an answer. There is &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/2505" target="_blank"&gt;an add-on&lt;/a&gt; that's supposed to do this, but it hasn't been updated in years, and doesn't work on the latest version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's the process that worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your address book, and select the address book that you wish to de-duplicate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Tools &amp;gt; Export, and export the address book as a CSV file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open that file in OpenOffice Spreadsheet, and sort it by the column called "Display Name"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert a column to the left (or right, whatever) of the "Display Name" 
 column, and fill it with entries such as &lt;code&gt;=if(C2=C3, "Duplicate", 
 "OK")&lt;/code&gt; Where C corresponds with the column in which you're looking for 
 duplicates. Fill the entire column with such entries all the way to the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, visually look for duplicates and delete them. Once that's done, do the same thing for the email address column, and you should be able to eliminate all the duplicates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get them back into Thunderbird, go to Tools &amp;gt; Import, and import the file. This will create a new address book by the name of the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From there, simply delete your old address book, and rename the new one to something useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All done!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thunderbird"></category><category term="de-dup"></category></entry><entry><title>Economics of Securing Government Information Systems: A Case Study</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/09/12/economics-of-securing-government-information-systems/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-09-12T13:48:45+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-09-12:posts/2009/09/12/economics-of-securing-government-information-systems/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Prior to becoming a student at the &lt;a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu" target="_blank"&gt;School of Information&lt;/a&gt;, I worked doing systems support for a government database that held hundreds of thousands of records, consisting of social security numbers, addresses, names, DOBs, etc. My job was to help users with any kinds of bugs they found in the system, and to work with the vendor to report and resolve those bugs. Over the years at this job, I spent a good amount of time doing security testing of the system. I found a number of vulnerabilities which I reported to the vendor, and which were quickly fixed. One of them however had been plaguing me from the time I found it, around 2007, until now. This post is the tale of that vulnerability, which I'm proud to say was fixed earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem that I discovered is a simple one, and is one that is &lt;a href="http://www.hotmail.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;widespread&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.gmx.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://webmail.juno.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://registration.excite.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;web&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put, the web-based system did not use encryption on the log on page, resulting in user names and passwords being sent over the Internet in plain text rather than ciphertext. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, without going into too much detail, this is not necessarily the end of the world. When you use the Internet, the information that transfers between you and websites is split up into packets, and these packets are sent down whatever wire appears to have the least load and the greatest speed. As a result, there is no guarantee all of your information will ever be sent through the same computer, and it's challenging for a hacker to place a computer between you and the website you're using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately though, there are some bottlenecks, and sometimes &amp;mdash; not always &amp;mdash; all of your information &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; pass through the same point between you and the server. Bottlenecks can occur in a number of places, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The web host's computers and wires&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Unless a custom &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server" target="_blank"&gt;DNS server&lt;/a&gt; is being used, all the information going to or from the server has to go through some host's computer system. If they are logging the information, and if the login information is sent in plaintext, they will immediately have it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fastest route&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Somewhere between you and the server, there may be one route that is fastest. It's possible that some computer in the middle will in fact be relaying all of the information to and from you and the server. They will, in effect, have all of the needed information to steal your login credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your network&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; If you're on a home or corporate network, more than likely, there is one or more bottlenecks between you and the Internet. This is a point where your information could be gathered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The network provider's computers&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Finally, your information will be passing through the hands of the network providers, so they have a wide scope of opportunities to inspect and analyze your information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, you might say that it's OK to have an unencrypted login page, if you don't mind having vulnerabilities at both endpoints and all along the middle of the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress and should proceed with the tale. Around 2007, I found this vulnerability and used &lt;a href="http://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate it to my managers and to the vendor. At that time, it seemed like it would be quickly fixed, and that we could go on with our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then some time passed, and nothing happened. I reminded a few people, but still nothing. The problem persisted, and I handed off my job to somebody else so that I could go back to school. But even once I was back in school, occasionally something would remind me of the problem, and I'd check to see if it was fixed. But it wasn't. So I reminded my old co-workers that they had a problem (which wasn't my favorite thing to do), and I assumed it would be taken care of. Except it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had to decide how much of a moral duty I had to get this fixed, since I was unaffiliated with the organization for about a year by that time. Proceeding to bring up this issue meant that I would probably annoy a number of people, and that I would likely damage relationships I had spent years building, but to not bring it up meant that thousands of people's records would continue to be insecure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this balance in mind, I decided to contact the vendor about it some more, and to continue contacting him every so often until it was fixed. Ultimately, after an additional three or four months and about five long phone calls it's finally fixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions now are, what took so damned long, and what can be done to avoid this in the future? Well, a number of things factored in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staff transitions&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Part-way through this time, I left my job and transitioned to school. While I did mention this problem to my replacement, I also mentioned about 500 other things. Sadly, this one may not have caught his attention, or I did not emphasize it enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of security personnel&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Nowhere in either organizations was there a person that was designated to discover and push security problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vagueness of the problem&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; I was able to demonstrate the problem to my superiors and to the vendor, and to explain how it could be a problem, but it wasn't a smoking gun. There had been no security failure, nor was there any obvious thing that an average user could exploit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competing projects&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; At the time I discovered the problem, there were many other competing projects that were on the table. To push them aside to fix a vague and unexploited problem did not seem like a good use of resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationship maintenance and imbalances&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; In 2007, when I reported this, I was not a part of the senior management, and did not have a strong relationship with the vendor. Conversely, my bosses &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have a relationship with the vendor, but they might not have wanted to jeopardize it by pressuring the vendor to fix a security problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vague economic incentives&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; With this 
vulnerability, it was unclear if anybody would ever know if a hacker had 
been logging into the system and collecting information. If one had, 
it's vague where the burden of the problem would fall. It's not certain 
whether it would fall on my organization or the vendor. And anyway, 
because &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/" target="_blank"&gt;HIPAA&lt;/a&gt;
is so massive, and because there are many other laws that come into play 
(such as the &lt;a href="http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/appndxa/civil/civ1798_82.htm" 
target="_blank"&gt;data breach laws of CA&lt;/a&gt;), it's unclear what exactly they
  would have to to as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things did not factor in that one might expect to be relevant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everybody wanted to fix it. Nobody thought it shouldn't be fixed or that it shouldn't be prioritized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody dropped the ball and didn't get it done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were no structural impediments to getting it reported to the proper people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It wasn't a complicated or difficult thing to fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It wasn't a trivial problem, nor one that was difficult to exploit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum therefore, it appears that it was economic, social and personnel challenges that caused this to take so long to be fixed. So what can we do to fix these types of problems? A number of things come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full-time security personnel&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; The most important thing for one of the organizations to do is to hire somebody to complete regular security audits. This person needs to be hired full time so that they understand the complexity of the problems, and so they can be there to push the solutions forward until things are fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity of economic burden&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; With so much information being stored in the system, it should be made explicit to both parties what the plan is in case of a data loss, and where the burden lies in that event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared bug reporting&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Currently, there are about fifteen organizations that use this vendor for their information management, however there is no shared system of bug tracking or reporting. As a result, when security problems are found, organizations have no organized way to share information with each other.  Because each organization has a relationship to maintain with the vendor, none of them want to make the product look bad or vulnerable. This isolates the information, reducing the pressure on the vendor to fix such problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritization of security fixes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Finally, it's vital that such problems be prioritized so that they do not fall by the wayside, and so that they can all be fixed before they are exploited.&lt;/li&gt;

For some time I've been using the Firefox &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8636"&gt;Long URL Mobile Expander&lt;/a&gt;. It's a great add-on that expands the URLs from about &lt;a href="http://longurl.org/services"&gt;two hundred URL shortening services&lt;/a&gt; such as tinyurl.com and bit.ly. One problem it has though is that when you open certain files locally on your computer, it throws an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;error: current_domain is null
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty annoying error, and some kind person tracked it down and posted the fix in the comments. They did not, however, post an updated version of the add-on. So, attached to this message is the fixed version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second extension that I've been using for a long time is the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3818" target="_blank"&gt;Resizeable Textarea&lt;/a&gt; add-on. It allows you to drag the edge of text areas and form fields so that you can make them as big (or small) as you like. Unfortunately, the author hasn't updated the add-on since 2006, so it doesn't work on recent versions of Firefox. This is easy to fix, so I updated this one as well, and attached it to this post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Per the creator's comments below, you can find an updated and fixed version of the Long URL Expander in experimental status here: &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/8636#version-2" target="_blank"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/8636#version-2&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2, 10-2-2009:&lt;/strong&gt; Turns out that the fixed version of Resizeable Textarea on the mozilla site doesn't actually work. An updated version is attached though.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="firefox"></category><category term="add-on"></category><category term="longurl"></category></entry><entry><title>Firefox Modifications for Maximal Screen Real Estate and Usability</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/08/12/firefox-modifications-for-real-estate-and-usability/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-08-12T11:34:22+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-08-12:posts/2009/08/12/firefox-modifications-for-real-estate-and-usability/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been playing around lately with concepts to make Firefox more useful on my laptop, and I've come up with a few solutions I thought I would share. The idea here is to take the best concepts from Chrome and Safari, and apply them to Firefox. These changes will maximize your use of screen real estate, and will make Firefox a little easier to use at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these are set up, Firefox will look like this:
&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Firefox%20Screenshot.preview.png"&gt;
These changes do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the status bar to 1px at the bottom of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the menu bar to a small icon to the right of the URL bar (like Chrome)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move the tabs to the top of the browser (like Chrome)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlights the domain part of each URL (like Chrome)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make links appear in the URL bar when you hover over them (since the status bar is eliminated)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a progress bar in the URL bar rather than in the status bar (like Safari)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes that are needed to enable all this are a bit complicated, but not too bad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminating the status bar at the bottom of the screen creates about 35 pixels of vertical space that is otherwise not used for very much. By making it only one pixel, hovering over the bottom of your browser window will pop it up, in case you need it. To do this, you need the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2108" target="_blank"&gt;Stylish extension&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/3600" target="_blank"&gt;this Stylish script&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing the menu bar to only a small icon achieves the same goal of creating screen space. To do so, I recommend the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4550" target="_blank"&gt;Compact Menu&lt;/a&gt; extension. A word of warning though: this one takes some configuration after installation. (The Tiny Menu extension will also work, but you can't move the icon to the right-hand side, which makes the back button much more difficult to use.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After some consideration, I decided to move my tabs above the URL bar because the URL bar and the associated buttons really do apply to whatever page is being displayed. Which is to say that the URL is part of the tab, and should be displayed under it - not vice versa. To make this change is pretty easy - simply install the Stylish script &lt;a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/10986" target="_blank"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting the domain in the URL bar, and graying out the rest is a simple and useful trick that helps to avoid scam sites that might be trying to impersonate a valid web site. To make this change, simply install the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4014" target="_blank"&gt;Locationbar&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; extension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since we eliminated the status bar, one thing we'll need back is the ability to see where a link takes us before we click on it. By making it appear in the URL bar rather than the status bar, our eyes only need to look in one place, and the result of clicking on a link is shown to us before we click on it. To make this change, there is a setting in the &lt;a href="http://mozilla.zeniko.ch/fission.html" target="_blank"&gt;Fission extension&lt;/a&gt;, which is also used to display progress in the URL bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might note at this point that in the screenshot above that I've also eliminated the search box from the navigation toolbar, thus allowing more space for the URL bar. To replace the search box's functionality, I recommend the &lt;a href="http://cybernetnews.com/cybersearch/" target="_blank"&gt;Cybersearch extension&lt;/a&gt;, which uses keywords in the URL bar to complete searches. For example, if I type "wiki windows," it gives me the top ten wikipedia pages for the term windows:
&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Firefox%20Cybersearch%20Example.preview.png"&gt;
This also works for Google and Amazon, and just about any other site you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all of this is completed, you should have created about 70 vertical pixels of new space in your browser, maintained all the previous functionality, and improved the usability of a couple of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="firefox"></category><category term="extensions"></category><category term="usability"></category><category term="stylish"></category></entry><entry><title>A Fresh Install of Vista on an HP Laptop</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/07/23/a-fresh-install-of-vista-on-an-hp-laptop/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-07-23T21:59:02+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-07-23:posts/2009/07/23/a-fresh-install-of-vista-on-an-hp-laptop/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just used a recovery disk to install Vista on an HP laptop.

It's a little hard to explain gnome-do without an example, so I'll explain how I just made the following tweet, sharing a picture from my garden: &lt;blockquote&gt;Artichoke has finally flowered. It's quite something: &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/mn7pjp" target="_blank"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/mn7pjp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;To make this tweet, I needed to find the picture on my computer, upload it to the web, create a tinyurl of the picture's location, and then tweet the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the process would be the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a web browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to a photo sharing site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the upload button, and press it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browse to the photo on your computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the photo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click the uploaded photo, and select "Copy Link Location"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to TinyURL.com, and shorten the URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the new URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in if necessary, and write your tweet
All in all a rather arduous process. Using gnome-do, the process is rather simpler. Gnome-do operates by allowing you to choose an object (such as a picture, a contact in your address book, an album, etc.), and then perform an action on it (such as upload the picture, write the contact an email, play the selected album, etc.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, what I had to do was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summon gnome-do by pressing Super + Space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type the first few letters in the name of the picture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press tab. Type "u" for "upload," and press enter. This uploads the picture, and tells me its URL at imageshack.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press tab, type "t" to "make a tinyurl" of the picture's location at imageshack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type tab, then "copy" to copy the tinyurl to the clipboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summon gnome-do a second time, and type out my twitter message, paste in the tinyurl, and press tab, then "post to twitter".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it. It sounds more complicated than it is. In reality, to make the above tweet, I pressed the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;Super + Space, Arti, u, enter. This uploaded the photo to imageshack.com, and returned it's location.
Tab, t, enter. This created a tinyurl of the location.
Tab, c, enter. This copied the tinyurl to the clipboard.
Twitter message, CTRL + V, tab, t. This posted my twitter message.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there is a bit of a learning curve, and some configuration that you have to set up so it knows your usernames, but once it is set, it makes such complicated posts much easier to complete. And I should mention, this is only the beginning of what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ubuntu"></category><category term="gnome-do"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Papa's Got a Brand New Look</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/04/26/papas-got-a-brand-new-look/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-04-26T11:31:19+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-04-26:posts/2009/04/26/papas-got-a-brand-new-look/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, here's the scoop. I've given the site a major revamp and a new look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the old one:
&lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/oldsitev3/Site%20v3.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/oldsitev3/Site%20v3,%20thumb.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the new:
&lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/oldsitev3/Site%20v.4.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/oldsitev3/Site%20v.4,%20thumb.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/poll/new-theme-old-theme"&gt;And here's a poll to make a vote and/or comment on the changes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a number of reasons I wanted to make a change, and I think the new design accomplishes most of them. First, I wanted to change to a static width layout. It was a long time coming, and now people with big screens and/or high resolution won't have to deal with ridiculous line lengths. Second, the new design should do wonders for links, which didn't really stand out before. Third, I've dropped the login box at the right, since I was the only one that ever logged in. Actually, I've dropped the whole column, so we're down to two columns now, not three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I wasn't really planning on doing was the color change. I liked the muted greens, but I think the topics I discuss have largely moved away from environmental ones, so perhaps the blue makes more sense and will better evoke what I'm going for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine recently had a rather unfortunate event involving her twitter 
public timeline, so I thought the time had come to make mine private, more or 
less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I needed to update the code that pulls my most recent Twitter 
posts into the left hand column so that it would authenticate using the 
Twitter API. Here's the new code - it ain't pretty, but it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Your twitter username &amp;amp; password.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;YOUR_USERNAME&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;YOUR_TWITTER_PASSWORD&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Concatenate the username and password&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$userpass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Make up the feed URL&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$feed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline.atom?count=1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//A function to parse the atom feed and pull out the useful info.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse_feed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$feed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One dependency is the php-curl library, and after you install that, apache2 
will want a restart. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blog"></category><category term="Twitter"></category></entry><entry><title>Installing Tracker from Source</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/02/23/installing-tracker-from-source/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-02-23T00:13:40+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-02-23:posts/2009/02/23/installing-tracker-from-source/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been working over the past several weeks on getting Tracker to work better on my system. There are a couple reasons that I'm doing this. The first is that by default on Ubuntu, Tracker doesn't support a number of meta formats (such as the tags in JPEGs, ID3 info in MP3s, and the like). The second was that the RDF parsing code in the default Ubuntu version is a bit buggy, and the new version is better. It's been a bit of a pain figuring out the install process, so I figured I'd post here so others might have an easier time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://projects.gnome.org/tracker/start.html" target="_blank"&gt;online instructions&lt;/a&gt; say to simply download the code, and to install it. No big deal, right? Well...in reality, it's a bit harder than that. The process I went through was to download the source from &lt;a href="http://projects.gnome.org/tracker/download.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; per the instructions, unpack the source files, and to run the configure command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the configure command is run each time, it will give you a summary of which components will be installed, and which will not. If you have all the dependencies necessary, and include a couple of arguments to the configure command, everything will get installed. If not, certain pieces will be missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of dependencies is a bit long, so before you run ./configure, you might as well install them. To do so, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo aptitude install libgmime-2.0-2a libgmime-2.0-2-dev dbus-glib-1-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libhal-dev libhal-storage-dev sqlite3-dev libsqlite3-dev libexif-dev libdeskbar-tracker libgsf-1-dev libjpeg62-dev libtiff4-dev libxine-dev libpoppler-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev libpoppler-glib-dev libtotem-plparser-dev libunac1-dev libexempi-dev libraptor1-dev libtracker-gtk-dev libgnome-desktop-dev libgnome-desktop-dev libnotify-dev
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once those are installed, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;./configure --enable-deskbar-applet --enable-tracker-applet --prefix&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/usr --sysconfdir&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/etc
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After this, it should say that pretty much everything will be installed. If so, you can proceed to the commands below, and once those are complete, the latest version should be installed with full functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;make

home, I can configure my computer to download my mail over the intranet 
whenever I am on my home network. By doing this, I can drastically reduce my
mail download times because it cuts the Internet out of the equation. Rather
than using DNS + the Internet to get my mail, I can download it directly 
from internal IP address of the server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how to set this up, you have to understand that whenever you 
use a domain name (like michaeljaylissner.com), your computer does an IP 
lookup. First, it looks in /etc/hosts to see if it knows the IP of the 
domain locally. If it does, it will use the IP listed there. If it does 
not, it will ask your Internet provider what IP to use, 
and will use that. Thus, what we want to do is set up the computer so that 
when we are at home, /etc/hosts provides the internal IP of our server, 
and so when we are not at home, it does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am at home, I am always on a wireless network called, 
&lt;code&gt;pizzapuppysantaclaus&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, by checking what wireless network I am 
connected to, I can check if I am at home, and make whatever changes are 
necessary. Conveniently, whenever you change network connections, 
you run all of the scripts located in &lt;code&gt;/etc/network/if-up.d/&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, 
we will put a small script in there that checks what wireless network we are
 on, and then changes our /etc/hosts file if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up this configuration, I made three files. The first is the script 
mentioned above, which needs to be owned by root, 
and placed in &lt;code&gt;/etc/network/if-up.d&lt;/code&gt;. You can name it whatever you want, 
and by changing &lt;code&gt;pizzapuppysantaclaus&lt;/code&gt; to the name of your network, 
you can fit it to your needs. Here's the contents of the script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#First, we check if we are connected to pizzapuppysantaclaus&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;#If grep has a hit, we&amp;#39;re connected, and $? will equal 0, if not, $? will equal 1&lt;/span&gt;
iwconfig 2&amp;gt; /dev/null | grep pizzapuppysantaclaus &amp;gt; /dev/null

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 0 &lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;#Switch the /etc/hosts file with the other one&lt;/span&gt;
  cp -f /etc/hostsIntranet /etc/hosts

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;#Switch the /etc/hosts file with the other one&lt;/span&gt;
  cp -f /etc/hostsInternet /etc/hosts

&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;exit &lt;/span&gt;0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This script simply performs a check of our wireless ID. If it's 
&lt;code&gt;pizzapuppysantaclaus&lt;/code&gt;, it switches &lt;code&gt;/etc/hostsIntranet&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;. If 
not, it switches &lt;code&gt;/etc/hostsInternet&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of &lt;code&gt;/etc/hostsIntranet&lt;/code&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;192.168.1.132   michaeljaylissner.com
192.168.1.132   charityhikers.org
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.1.1   opal

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts&lt;/span&gt;
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And &lt;code&gt;/etc/hostsInternet&lt;/code&gt; is just a copy of &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to make this whole thing run, put the script in &lt;code&gt;/etc/network/if-up.d&lt;/code&gt;, 
and set its owner to root with execute permission. Create a file called 
&lt;code&gt;/etc/hostsIntranet&lt;/code&gt;, that contains your intranet configuration, 
as shown above. Make a copy of your normal &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; file called 
&lt;code&gt;/etc/hostsInternet&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all that's done, you should be all set. Any questions, 
please feel free to comment!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="script"></category><category term="project"></category><category term="/etc/hosts"></category><category term="networking"></category><category term="DNS"></category></entry><entry><title>Twitter (and Facebook) Integrated</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/01/25/twitter-and-facebook-integrated/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-25T13:03:03+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-01-25:posts/2009/01/25/twitter-and-facebook-integrated/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I upgraded the site a bit today by adding my Twitter/Facebook feed to left-hand sidebar.

One project was the &lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/blog/yelp-scraper" target="_blank"&gt;Yelp scraper&lt;/a&gt; that I posted about previously, and another was a report for my old work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report is a statistical analysis of the development of about 2,000 children aged three and four. For those interested, I'll try to post it here once the final version is ready to go. In the past when making the report, I had been frustrated because there was no easy way to script the creation of the 30 or so charts that need to be made. Excel had been our data analysis tool, and as such, we were stuck with either using VBA to create charts, or to do it by hand. Since nobody knew VBA, we always just buckled down and did the work by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, I discovered the &lt;a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"&gt;matplotlib Python library&lt;/a&gt;, and used that to create the charts. It was an pretty rough experience all in all. While simple graphs can be created in about five lines of code, creating complicated ones took a good amount of work. For example, to change the tick markers on a graph requires that you create tick objects, and then manipulate them each individually in a for loop. Granted, I couldn't customize them at all in Excel, but figuring out that kind of change was a pain indeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report itself required about 1,000 lines of code, and each chart required about 100-200 lines. For custom charts, I didn't find the library that useful, however towards the end of the report there are 30 charts, all of which are identical, except for the data. For these charts, I was able to make a for loop that created them all in about 20 minutes, whereas previously these took me a few hours to make by hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another library I spent some time learning was the &lt;a href="http://www.cairographics.org/pycairo/" target="_blank"&gt;pycairo&lt;/a&gt; library, which allows pixel by pixel editing of pictures. I had planned to use it to do any editing to the charts that I was unable to accomplish with the matplotlib library, but in the end, it was unnecessary. I have another project coming up though that will use the pycairo library, so look for that soon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Python"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="matplotlib"></category><category term="pycairo"></category><category term="project"></category></entry><entry><title>Yelp Scraper to Get Business Info in a Geographic Area</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/12/21/yelp-scraper/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-12-21T16:41:13+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-12-21:posts/2008/12/21/yelp-scraper/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent the past couple days on one of my first Python projects - using the &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/developers" target="_blank"&gt;Yelp API&lt;/a&gt; to compile a list of restaurants in a defined geographic area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a good project. Because of some limitations of the API, I had to do some interesting tricks to make it work. One problem with the API is that it only allows 20 hits per query, so if you want to do a big query, you have to divide it up into tiny queries that have fewer than 20 hits each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish that, if a query gets 20 hits within those two points, it will divide the longer dimension of the rectangle created by the points in half, and perform a query on each of those two new rectangles. For each of those, if there are 20 hits, it will again divide it in two and perform two new queries, and so forth until less than 20 hits are found for the rectangle. Once less than 20 hits are found, the data is entered into a database. Once all the points have been added to the database, a comma separated file is created, and the program ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty incredible switching to Python for this project from my usual Java, and also using an official API for the first time. This project ended up being about 200 lines (half of which are comments). I can't imagine how long it would be with Java, since I used some rather powerful Python modules to accomplish this (namely, csv, urllib &amp;amp; json).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anybody is interested in seeing/using the code, let me know. It should be useful if you need a list of restaurants or other businesses in a certain area. Worthy causes only please!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Python"></category><category term="yelp"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="scrape"></category></entry><entry><title>Rsnapshot Backup Solution OR Why Backing Up Is Hard To Do</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/12/09/rsnapshot-backup-solution-or-why-backing-up-is-hard-to-do/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-12-09T22:06:48+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-12-09:posts/2008/12/09/rsnapshot-backup-solution-or-why-backing-up-is-hard-to-do/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been working on getting this post figured out for about five months. In this post, I am going to try to explain exactly how my backup works, and why. It's ridiculously complicated at times, but the detail is necessary on paper in some form or other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my backup system, I rely heavily on &lt;a href="http://rsnapshot.org" target="_blank"&gt;rsnapshot&lt;/a&gt;, which is a tool that uses rsync and some perl scripting to create snapshots of directories. Rsync is a pretty awesome tool. It functions like a simple copy/paste, except that it will check the destination directory of the paste and will only copy the necessary files. As such, it can be interrupted in the middle of a copy, and will be able to continue later where it left off. Perl is a scripting language that has been used with rsync to give it some extra power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This power is the ability to perform incremental backups, which is to say that if I have 5GB of data that I backup 10 days in a row, it will only take up about 5GB of data, total. However, if I have 5GB of data today, an additional 5GB tomorrow, and another 5GB the day after, which I backup each day for ten days, it will only require a total of 5GB of space the first day, 10GB the second day, 15GB the third day, and no more space after that for the remaining 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important if you want to backup your data on a regular basis. Since I run a server, I have several things that I must backup. I back these up on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. The list includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My laptop is backed up wirelessly to the server's hard drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The email server gets copied to an external USB drive (this includes all the Zimbra configuration files as well as thousands of emails)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web server gets backed up to the USB drive (this includes the Drupal installation and the MySQL database)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of configuration files for the servers go to the USB drive (i.e. the /etc/ directory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, the backup configuration itself goes to the USB drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these backups presents some challenging difficulties. For the web server, it is challenging because it is backing up MySQL, Zimbra and Drupal. In order to do this, I have to coordinate the MySQL database dump so that when the Drupal backup is triggered, it will copy the MySQL information over to the USB drive along with the normal Drupal information. For Zimbra, the email server has to be stopped, backed up, and then started again, which means control of the email server has to be carefully scripted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laptop presents a challenge because it is the only thing that is backed up wirelessly, and in order to do so, the server must authenticate itself to the laptop before it is allowed to log in and make the copies. If that wasn't complicated enough, in addition, the laptop needs to be set up with a static IP address so that the server can find it to perform the backup. Finally, the laptop needs to be ON, and connected to the network when the server attempts the backup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all of that is figured out logically, you have to authenticate the laptop to the server, create the scripts, backup configurations and cron files. I have attached some of these configuration files to this post, provided they don't reveal too much of my network topology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final challenge that had to be overcome was connecting the USB drive to the server in such a way that it would always be mounted in the same location. In addition, I learned that FAT32 doesn't support file system links, and so I had to format the USB drive as ext3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, it's about five months since I began this project, and I believe I can say that the backup happens flawlessly on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. There are a few things I'd like to change however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;I'd like to get an email notification when a backup fails&lt;/del&gt; &amp;mdash; Done - See comment below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;I'd like to begin backing up /etc/ on my laptop&lt;/del&gt; &amp;mdash; Done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;At one point, I was backing up a list of all the installed software on my system - it'd be nice to have that again&lt;/del&gt; &amp;mdash; Done - I wrote a python script to do so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;The backup is unencrypted, so anybody can take the USB drive and have a heck of a lot of emails. Gotta fix that.&lt;/del&gt; &amp;mdash; See the note below in the comments for details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Files of Interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/files/rsnapshotOpal2.conf"&gt;rsnapshot configuration&lt;/a&gt; for my laptop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/files/rsnapshotDrupal.conf"&gt;rsnapshot configuration&lt;/a&gt; for the Drupal server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/files/rsnapshotEtcHome.conf"&gt;rsnapshot configuration&lt;/a&gt; for the backup configuration files and the /etc directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/files/rsnapshotZimbra.conf"&gt;rsnapshot configuration&lt;/a&gt; for the Zimbra server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scripts to &lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/files/ZimbraStop"&gt;stop&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/files/ZimbraStart"&gt;start&lt;/a&gt; Zimbra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My &lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/files/cronlist.txt"&gt;cron file&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, this just goes to show that backing up is a very difficult thing to do properly and automatically. It's one thing if you have a desktop that backs up to a USB drive. It's another if you have a server and a laptop. Had I known how long this would take going into it, I'm not sure I would have figured it all out. How the average computer user is supposed to figure this out is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rsnapshot"></category><category term="archive"></category><category term="backup"></category><category term="project"></category></entry><entry><title>We Knew It Existed - The Official Definition of The Internet</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/12/07/we-knew-it-existed-the-official-definition-of-the-internet/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-12-07T23:43:25+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-12-07:posts/2008/12/07/we-knew-it-existed-the-official-definition-of-the-internet/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On October 24, 1995, the Federal Networking Council met and decided that the

It has a lot of good features including a calendar, address book, memos and mail, as well as a number of others. One problem though is that it gets caught up when processing mail, and sometimes just won't come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other problem is that it has several helper apps that are behind the scenes making things work properly, so if you try to just kill the application itself, those will still be running and your problem may not be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to write a short script to kill all of Evolution and its helper apps. Hope this helps somebody else someday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;::: bash
% more bin/evokill 
&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

ps aux | grep evolution
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;kill&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;ps aux | grep evolution | awk -F&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39; &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;{print $2}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This script just looks for any application that has the word evolution in its name, and then sends it the kill signal. Not too sophisticated, but it gets the job done. You could easily substitute the word evolution for something else as well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="evolution"></category><category term="bash"></category></entry><entry><title>Delete Original Images from F-Spot and Rotate Using Exif Information</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/09/15/delete-original-images-from-f-spot-and-rotate-using-exif-information/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-09-15T23:33:48+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-09-15:posts/2008/09/15/delete-original-images-from-f-spot-and-rotate-using-exif-information/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple weeks, my girlfriend and I spent a lot of time working on the photos from our Peru trip. Since we used F-Spot to do our photo editing, when we were done we had a couple of problems when it came to transferring the photos back to her computer which is running Vista. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem was that when we rotated images with F-Spot, it simply changed the exif information for the photo, and didn't change the pixels of the photo themselves. This was fine when viewed in F-Spot because it is aware of exif information, and displays the photos correctly. However, when we transferred the files to her computer, we discovered that Vista does not take exif information into account on the OS level, nor does Picassa. As a result, we needed to somehow rotate the images that had exif information indicating a non-normal rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem we encountered is that in F-Spot when you edit a photo, it creates a second file with the edited photo, and leaves the original unchanged. So, if you edit file dsc00343.jpg, you get a second photo called dsc00343 (Modified).jpg. This is OK when in F-Spot, however, when we went to her computer, it was very hard for her to have ONLY the modified version of those photos, and to delete the originals (since the edited versions are better than the originals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve the first problem, I used a couple of tricks. The first thing I did was to make a copy of the photos in case all went south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mkdir backupPhotos
cp *.jpg *.jpeg backupPhotos
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;backupPhotos
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once that is done, we can begin rotating images. For this, we will need the jhead program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo aptitude install jhead
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once that's installed, we rotate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;jhead -autorot  *.jpg *.jpeg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will rotate all of the files that have unusual information in the exif orientation field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem number one solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For problem two, we will need to isolate all of the photos that have been modified, and delete the originals. To do this, we will capitalize on the fact that the renamed images use the original pictures name in their name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we create a list of the photos that have been modified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ls *.jpg *.jpeg | grep -i modified &amp;gt; modifiedImages.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using awk, we can separate out the original name of the photos. The following 
commands will convert the ')' to '(' and will use the two '(' as a delimiters, 
returning the name of the file as the first field, and the .jpg or .jpeg as 
the third field. After that, it will remove any spaces from the file name, and 
will create a new file with a list of the modified pictures. It sounds 
complicated, but the final result should work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;tr &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;(&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;lt; modifiedImages.txt &amp;gt; modifiedImages2.txt
cat modifiedImages2.txt | awk -F&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;(&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;{print $1,$3;}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | sed &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;s/  //g&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;gt; modifiedImages3.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You should now have a file called modifiedImages3.txt that contains the name of all of the original photos. To delete the pictures in this list from the collection - permanently - run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;rm &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;cat modifiedImages3.txt&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You should now be able to transfer this entire directory of photos to another computer without rotation issues or duplicated photos.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="script"></category><category term="f-spot"></category><category term="awk"></category><category term="grep"></category></entry><entry><title>Linux Tip - Route Standard Output Into to the Clipboard</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/08/28/linux-tip-route-standard-output-into-the-clipboard/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-28T20:47:05+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-08-28:posts/2008/08/28/linux-tip-route-standard-output-into-the-clipboard/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friendly online stranger just taught me how to do something that has been plaguing me for some time. Ever since I learned how to use pipes in the unix commandline, I have wanted to know how to pipe the output of a command into the system clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the echo command simply repeats whatever you tell it to. So if I run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo &lt;/span&gt;hello
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The computer will give me the output &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;hello
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By using a pipe (this symbol: |) I can route the output of one command into the input of another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if I run: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo &lt;/span&gt;hello | helloprogram
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The helloprogram will receive the value of 'hello' as an input, and will do something with it. This allows stringing together small commands into long ones, which sometimes is incredibly handy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you want to route standard output into the system clipboard, you will need to install an application called xclip. Once that is installed, a command such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo &lt;/span&gt;hello | xclip -i -selection clipboard
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Will put the word hello into the clipboard. Ctrl + V will then paste that 
value into whatever application desired.&lt;/p&gt;

Originally, I had one server for Zimbra, and the other for Drupal. I did this because I was scared that if I didn't, people would be unable to access the website without getting the email, and vice versa. I had no familiarity with apache, and a limited understanding of ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, today I had a moment of inspiration, and decided it was time to retire the older of the two servers, and to move the Drupal installation to the Zimbra server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to reducing the number of servers that I am maintaining, this also reduces the amount of energy I'm consuming, and also allowed me to update my Drupal installation. I was running Drupal 5.3 because that was the one that was in the Ubuntu repos, but I am now up to 5.9 (the most recent version).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how did it go? It went pretty well. I had a backup of everything on my second server already, so it was largely a matter of copying things to the right places. Probably the most important lesson I learned is that symbolic links are not followed by rsnapshot, so my backups until this time have been incomplete. In my new installation, I am not using symbolic links, so that problem should be alleviated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge I encountered was that I had to update my dbconfig.php files to line up with the new database configuration, and I also had to spend some time getting the correct document root to function in apache2, which I also just installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem I encountered was that the clean URL's broke, and were a pain to get fixed. I have fixed those now, so the only remaining thing is to get gallery functioning again. The thing to remember here is that clean urls function by directory, and that the higher up the directory tree you go, the higher the priority of the .htacces files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Gallery2, I have to say it is a big pain, so I may just revert to trusting Google with my images. We'll see if I have another moment of inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="drupal"></category><category term="apache2"></category></entry><entry><title>Wake Your Computer by USB</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/07/14/wake-your-computer-by-usb/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-14T20:27:57+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-07-14:posts/2008/07/14/wake-your-computer-by-usb/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently began using my laptop at my desk with a USB keyboard and mouse, 
and I thought I would explain how to set up Ubuntu so that USB peripherals 
will wake up your computer from sleep mode. This is convenient if you have 
your laptop set up such that the lid is closed and inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ubuntu, the way to set this up is to edit the file located at 
&lt;code&gt;/proc/acpi/wakeup&lt;/code&gt;. To see the current contents of this file do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;% cat /proc/acpi/wakeup
Device  S-state   Status   Sysfs node
P0P2      S4     disabled  
P0P1      S4     disabled  pci:0000:00:1e.0
MC97      S4     disabled  
HDAC      S4     disabled  pci:0000:00:1b.0
P0P4      S4     disabled  pci:0000:00:1c.0
P0P5      S4     disabled  pci:0000:00:1c.1
P0P7      S4     disabled  
P0P8      S4     disabled  
P0P9      S4     disabled  
USB0      S3     disabled  pci:0000:00:1d.0
USB1      S3     disabled  pci:0000:00:1d.1
USB2      S3     disabled  pci:0000:00:1d.2
USB3      S3     disabled  pci:0000:00:1d.3
EUSB      S3     disabled  pci:0000:00:1d.7
P0P6      S4     disabled  pci:0000:00:1c.2
SLPB      S4    *enabled
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This shows you a number of devices, most of which I don't claim to 
understand. The ones to notice are the USB ones, which you will see are 
disabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these are toggled on, your computer will wake up from sleep when USB 
peripherals are used. To toggle one of these on, as root, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;USB0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will toggle USB0 from disabled to enabled. To check this, 
run &lt;code&gt;cat /proc/acpi/wakeup&lt;/code&gt; again. You should see that it's enabled, 
and you should be able to test this by suspending your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will set up your computer to wake up from USB...for now. To make it 
work after your computer has been restarted, you will need to write a short 
init script named wake.sh with the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;USB0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Save this file to &lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d&lt;/code&gt;, and make it executable by running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;chmod +x wake.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, once this file is in &lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d&lt;/code&gt;, and is executable, 
as root run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;update-rc.d wake.sh defaults
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That will make init know about the file, and run it at startup. Happy 
awakenings!&lt;/p&gt;

The first was to bookmark the gmail logout link into their browser or maybe del.icio.us so that I could visit it without having to go to their gmail, and the second solution was to post that link here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you know that you want to log out your friend from gmail without seeing their inbox, all you have to do is &lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?logout&amp;hl=en-GB"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="google"></category><category term="infotech"></category></entry><entry><title>Install Citrix In Ubuntu Hardy Heron</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/06/02/install-citrix-in-ubuntu-hardy-heron/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-06-02T09:44:53+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-06-02:posts/2008/06/02/install-citrix-in-ubuntu-hardy-heron/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For a while there, I was struggling to get the Citrix client installed on 
my computer. It was frustrating, and I put hours into debugging it, 
and trying to get it to work. In the end, I took a circuitous route, 
installing VirtualBox in Ubuntu, Windows in VirtualBox, Firefox in Windows,
and finally Citrix in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I took another stab at getting this done, and for some reason it
went very smoothly. To install Citrix in Ubuntu Hardy Heron, begin by 
&lt;a href="http://www.citrix.com/English/ss/downloads/details.asp?downloadId=3323&amp;amp;productId=186&amp;amp;c1=ost1349860#top"&gt;downloading&lt;/a&gt; the Citrix client as a .tar.gz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, unpack the install file using the terminal by running: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo tar xvfz en.linuxx86.tar.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Change into the Citrix directory, and run &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo ./setupwfc
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will begin the install script. As it proceeds, 
simply allow the default settings, and you should be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step is to install the root certificates. To do this, 
attempt to start a Citrix program, and it may fail, 
reporting an error message. In the message, it will tell you what 
certificates it needs installed. Go to &lt;a href="https://www.geotrust.com/resources/root_certificates/index.asp"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;, and download the 
certificates the error message informed you that you need by right clicking 
their download links, and selecting "Save as..." Once those are downloaded,
rename their extension so they are .crt files, and move them to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::bash
 /usr/lib/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart Firefox, and you should be good.&lt;/p&gt;

the excel formulas that we use in our department documents. I started making a 
list of all the formulas, but my mind quickly went blank, and I decided I 
needed a way to automate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the technique I figured out. Open each of the files that you believe 
has useful formulas in it, and go to File &amp;gt; Save as... Save each document into 
an empty directory as xml spreadsheets (.xml). If you open one of these 
documents in a text editor, you are likely to see a line something like the 
following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Cell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ss:Formula=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;=SUM(C:C[1])&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ss:Type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Number&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Data&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Cell&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The key is that each row in your new xml documents that contains a formula 
will have the formula keyword, so to isolate these, run the following on a 
Unix computer in the directory where you saved all the xml documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;grep &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Formula=&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; *.xml | sort | uniq &amp;gt; uniqLinesWithFormulas.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That will create a file called uniqLinesWithFormulas.txt that will contain 
each line from all of your &lt;code&gt;.xml&lt;/code&gt; files that contains a formula. From there, 
you can skim them visually for useful formulas, or put the file into Excel 
again and play with it there. This was as far as I needed to go in my 
analysis. Once I had this done, it was pretty easy to see the 30 or so 
formulas I regularly use.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="microsoft"></category><category term="excel"></category></entry><entry><title>Drag a Screenshot Using ImageMagick</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/05/17/drag-a-screenshot-using-imagemagick/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-17T17:48:40+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-05-17:posts/2008/05/17/drag-a-screenshot-using-imagemagick/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I learned an interesting trick while working on the Fuji water article. We all know that if you want to take a screenshot in Linux, all you usually have to do is press the "printscreen" button. That, however, takes a screenshot of the entire screen, which you then have to trim down into a useful bit of picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick I learned to make this easy is to simply type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;import screenshot.png

&lt;p&gt;That will turn your cursor into a little crosshair, which you can drag across a section of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;

I was making too many mistakes. My solution was to remap the caps lock key on all the computers I use to act as an additional backspace key. How did I do it? Well, I'm glad you asked. I'll tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Windows&lt;/strong&gt;
EDIT: I noticed that the picture doesn't have all the detail you need. The easier way to do this, is to download the registry key attached to this post, and to right click it, selecting merge. After that, restart the computer, and you should be all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remap the caps lock to function as a backspace key in Windows, one must edit the registry keys. To do that, go to Start &amp;gt; Run..., and type in regedit. In the editor that opens up, navigate to the key shown in the picture below, and create a new key named Scancode Map of the type REG_BINARY. Give it the value shown in the picture, restart, and you're set. If things get wacky, delete the key and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/files/images/Windows%20Registry%20Remap%20Screenshot.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Linux&lt;/strong&gt;
I have tested the following in Ubuntu 7.04, 7.10, 8.04, 8.10, and 9.04. Start 
by opening a terminal, and running the xev program. Once that is running, 
press the caps lock key, and it will tell you the numerical value of that key. 
For example, my output from that command looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mlissner@opal2% xev
KeyPress event, serial 28, synthetic NO, window 0x4800001,
root 0x59, subw 0x0, &lt;span class="nb"&gt;time &lt;/span&gt;2775892, &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;373,636&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, root:&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;376,685&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;,
state 0x0, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;keycode 66&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;keysym 0xff08, Caps_Lock&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, same_screen YES,
XKeysymToKeycode returns keycode: 22
XLookupString gives 1 bytes: &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;08&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;XmbLookupString gives 1 bytes: (08) &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
XFilterEvent returns: False
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In there, you will see the keycode for the capslock key, in my case, number 
66. Using that, create a file in your home directory called .Xmodmap, and put 
the following in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Make&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;caps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;backspace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Lock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Caps_Lock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;keycode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;66&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;BackSpace&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once that is done, the next time you log in, your caps lock will function as a 
backspace. The only remaining problem is that it still does not have the 
auto-repeat function that backspace should have. To fix that, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;xset r 66
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That will make things work properly, but you need to run that every time you 
log in, or else it won't work properly. To fix that run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo gedit /etc/X11/Xsession.d/50x11-common_determine-startup
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And add xset r 66 to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should do it.&lt;/p&gt;

It took a lot of work to get this all figured out, so I thought I would put some notes together for those that may follow in my footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What challenged me the most with figuring this out were the concepts, so I want to touch on those more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to set up a multisite installation consists of the following general steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a new drupal database in your MySQL install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up the directory hierarchy in your drupal directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up your second domain as a virtual host in apache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure your settings.php file to point to your new database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the install.php script from your browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's really it, but it's kind of a complicated process. Some further 
notes expanding the concepts from above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're making your new MySQL database, I found the command line to 
be the easiest way to do it, but there are a lot of instructions on how to 
do it with web-based tools. For a good tutorial on the command line method 
check this out &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/node/22675" target="_blank"&gt;http://drupal.org/node/22675&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directory hierarchy was one of the more complicated parts of this for 
some reason. Essentially, it should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::bash
drupal/sites/default
drupal/sites/site1.com
drupal/sites/site2.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within site1.com and site2.com go your settings.php and dbconfig.php files.
If you like, you can put modules and themes directories as well. If you do, 
drupal will use these modules/themes if there is not a module/theme of the 
same name in the usual directory. This is really useful because it allows 
modules to be installed on one site, the other or both, 
depending on where you put the module's directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't remember exactly how I set up the virtual hosts, 
but the Internet has many resources on this one. The trick to know is that 
one virtual host points to the drupal/sites/site1.com directory, 
and the other points to the drupal/sites/site2.com directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No tricks here or on number five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="drupal"></category></entry><entry><title>New Website - CharityHikers.org</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/03/05/new-website-charityhikersorg/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-05T22:54:53+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-03-05:posts/2008/03/05/new-website-charityhikersorg/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post today to announce that I have finally figured out how to run a drupal multisite installation, and I have finally converted my old website, &lt;a href="http://www.charityhikers.org"&gt;CharityHikers.org&lt;/a&gt; over to Drupal. Making charityhikers.org a dynamically driven site has been one of my goals since about 2004, so completing this task is giving me an excellent dose of satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site began as a place where I could put up information about my hike for AIDS research, but I have developed it into something that other people can use to fundraise for their own causes. With this step, I think it is finally getting pretty close to a useful tool, but I still have a couple of things I'd like to accomplish with the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest goal I have for it is to allow hikers to sign up, and then update their profile with their charity and personal information, and to have that dynamically generate the menus, pages, etc. that are needed for the site so that their new information is automatically integrated. At present, pages have to be manually created through the CMS system, which is a bit of work, but it's not too bad all in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second goal I have is to allow picture uploading for hikers. It doesn't take a whole lot of storage space to do this, and it seems like a good service to provide. My current plan is to use gallery2 to accomplish this feat, but I'm having some serious issues with the database right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, goals and road maps aside, I'm really quite happy with this change. My real goal is for this site to really start bringing in donations. So far it's brought in a little over $10K, but in the scheme of things that's really not a whole lot of money...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="hiking"></category><category term="me"></category><category term="drupal"></category><category term="charityhikers"></category></entry><entry><title>Treasures of Old Websites Part II</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/02/26/treasures-of-old-websites-part-ii/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-02-26T19:07:14+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-02-26:posts/2008/02/26/treasures-of-old-websites-part-ii/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I also found the attached news articles I had posted on my website. Pretty funny stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pct"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="me"></category></entry><entry><title>Treasures of Old Websites</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/02/26/treasures-of-old-websites/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-02-26T18:58:04+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-02-26:posts/2008/02/26/treasures-of-old-websites/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been working the past couple of days on getting my other site, charityhikers.org moved over to my home server and recreated on Drupal. It's turning out to be a huge pain in the neck. The main problem is that there seem to be too many viable ways to accomplish what I want, and no consensus as to what the best one is. The result of this is that there are a number of half-hearted attempts at explaining how to have multiple sites running off of one Drupal installation, but none of them are really that detailed, or really apply all that well...it's frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However! In doing this, I discovered a treasure I thought I had lost. I discovered my old PCT journal entries, which I have posted below, by date. It's a bit long, so I won't be offended if nobody reads them, but it's interesting to see what I was thinking before the big trip back in '05. Unfortunately, I don't have any of the actual posts from the trail, so it's a bit of a cliff hanger. Alas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Entry - Madman Planning&lt;br&gt;21 March 2005&lt;/b&gt;
Well, it seems the journaling function of my site is finally up and running. It has been a long road to get here today, and I am glad we are finally nearing the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can not say I have really kept a journal very much in the past, so this is a bit of a foreign medium to me. I write lots of personal emails though, so perhaps I will just pretend I am writing one of my confidants, and see how that goes for a while. Nah. Too easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, planning for the trip comes along nicely these days. At this point, I am pretty much ready to go with the following enormous gaping holes in  my preparations:&lt;br&gt;1. I have not finalized my resupply bounce box, or the destinations it will be going to.&lt;br&gt;2. My first aid training from October is growing more and more useless by the day. I need to restudy it before the trip, but it is just so boring.&lt;br&gt;3. I need to move out.&lt;br&gt;4. Some sewing remains to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this means the planning is coming along nicely. Whatever the case, I will be ready when the time comes. I know what gear to take, and I have my many permits all taped to my wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I took some time to actually study my first aid stuff. I discovered that I had indeed forgotten the many nuances of it as I had imagined I would. I did think of a brilliant way to remember it all though: I finally made my own &lt;a href="http://www.aidshike.org/assets/spreadsheets/SOAPA_Note.xls"&gt;SOAP note&lt;/a&gt;. These are the things you use when an accident occurs to make sure you take all the right vital signs and ask all the right questions. By making my own, I essentially wrote myself a guide to first aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeesh this is a boring entry. I kind of just wanted to write it so that something would be here, and so people had something to read. I will write another one in a week or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Backpacking, Journaling, Etc&lt;br&gt;25 March 2005&lt;/b&gt;
Well, I think I said in the last journal entry that the journal site was done. That was a lie. It needs more work, and seems to be an interminable source of work. That having been said, I am fairly certain it is about done now. I have been working with a volunteer from Craigs List on getting everything to work the way I want it to, and the result has been pretty sweet thus far. Last night I stayed up rather late and got it to its present condition. A number of changes have been made to it, but nothing that will wow non-coders, so I am going to spare you all any more talk about this subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more interesting subject to talk about is the fact that I am going backpacking this weekend. It will probably be the last trip before the big one, so it is a bit stressful. I am trying out a couple of new things, namely some padding that I put into the straps of the M5 so it would hold more weight, some new shoes that I pro-dealed from Vasque, and I think that is about it. I might see if I can stand using Ken (my quilt). It is getting warmer out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that I haven not been able to decide is where the hell I want to go. I do not want to go to Big Sur because it is infested with Poison Oak and ticks, the trails are unreliable, and there is not that much ground to cover. So, that having been said, where should I go? Certainly not Point Reyes. Jesus that place is busy on a normal weekend, this is Easter weekend. I guess I could go to a more southern area in Los Padres forest and successfully dodge the snow down there. It is a long drive though. Much longer than I would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as the last hike before the trip, it is bound to be humbling. I think I can get at least 50 miles in this weekend, so that will be good experience as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skyline to Sea Trip Report &amp;raquo; Raccoons, Rains, and Rushing Waters&lt;br&gt;28 March 2005&lt;/b&gt;
Well, I am back from the trip, and it was quite awesome. Certainly something to write home about anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off the trip on Saturday, whereupon I learned that there was no legal parking at the trail head. Pretty damned annoying really. I get out of bed early to rush myself to the trailhead, where I learn that there is no parking. There is not even a ranger station, but there is a payphone to make up for the lack of cell phone coverage. So, I called the station, and made reservations for the campsites. Do you take credit cards? Naturally, they do not, and naturally the nearest ATM is about half an hour away. So, here I am, I have my reservations, but no way to pay for them, and I am at the trailhead, with nowhere to park within about ten miles. I spend about half an hour looking for parking, eventually finding a place I can pull off the road that does not have any &lt;i&gt;blatant&lt;/i&gt; signs saying I can't park there. I park. I hit the trail, and for the first 2/3rds of Saturday, I followed the road, crossing it every few miles. It was noisy, and lame, but eventually it kind of veered away from the road and became much more beautiful. By the time I finished my first 16 miles, and made camp, I was in the heart of the Big Basin Natural Park, a beautiful place indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon waking up the next day, I headed west yet again, towards the sea. Beauty was everywhere, but it was the best when I saw the beginnings of Barney Falls, which are by far the most beautiful waterfalls I have ever seen outside of Yosemite. Imagine if you will, hiking along through trees that have been around since the Byzantine Empire (probably), on this verdant and moist trail. It is gorgeous. Then, all of a sudden, you see a waterfall that is about 50 feet high, and rather wide in the middle of it all - Gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, I eventually, made it to the sea, and turned around to head 31 miles back to camp, and eventually my car. Along that direction, I saw a lot of the people that I had passed going the other way, and they were rather curious to see me coming at them a second time, but that is another story. The real story is that Rain was predicted. I made camp at Sunset Camp in what looked like a good spot if it should start raining. Well, it did start raining, and eventually that spot became flooded. I spent about an hour digging in the mud, making dikes and dams around my tarp, but in the end it proved to be a futile effort. I probably dumped out my 1L pot about 50 times before I gave up. It was a sad day, but luckily, moving my tarp was not such a big deal, so I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Night fell.&lt;br&gt;
With night came animals (the bastards). I was sleeping under my tarp in one hell of a rain storm. Thus I could hear just about nothing. I woke up to see what looked like something white moving away from my tent. It was a full moon, but the clouds made it pitch dark out. I grabbed for my flashlight, and discoverd that it was missing. Shit. I grabbed for my pack, where I had a backup light, and discovered IT was missing. SHIT. SHIT. SHIT. Bobcats have stolen my pack right from next to me under my tarp. I now have no light, and it is too dark to walk anywhere. Ok. I need to get a light from the people in the neighboring camp. They are asleep. I will have to wake them. Done. Ok. I have a light. It went on like that for about half an hour, eventually resulting in my discovery of everything that was once mine with the exception of my food bag, the food that was in it, and one of my (expensive titanium) stakes that had gone missing during the tent move. I tied my pack to my tarp with the theory being that if bobcats were going to steal my pack, they would have to wake me up to do it. They did come back to steal my EMPTY pack, but it is not like it woke me, and they were unable to get it untied. Oh, and they were apparently raccoons, not bobcats. So, in conclusion, I lost all of my food for the final day, and my pack got some tears in it. Not cool at all. So, I hiked out to the nearest road, informed the ranger, and hitch-hiked back to my car. All in all, about fifty miles covered, one storm bested, and a mafia of racoons fed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Training, Preparations and Having Both Arms Pulled In Opposite Directions&lt;br&gt;4 April 2005&lt;/b&gt;
So, the final weeks are upon us. There's no denying that now. How am I coping is probably the best question to ask at this point. The answer is that I'm losing a fair amount of sleep because I keep waking up with revelations pretty much every night, but other than that, I'm doing ok. Plus, I'm unemployed, so it doesn't particularly matter that I don't get the best sleep during the night because I can always just sleep more during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These revelations though, they&amp;#39;ve got to stop. Pretty much every night I either dream PCT, or wake up around four in the morning with the revelation that, &amp;quot;Put shampoo in your bounce box,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;ll want a phone card.&amp;quot; Really, I wish my brain would just take a chill pill. Last night was especially bad, which pretty much explains why I&amp;#39;m complaining about it so much. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that was due to the fact that I made (and ate) about a dozen cookies the day before though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend was good as far as training went. I did some sewing on Captain Tent for Mr. Boothe, and I made myself a right hand rain mitt out of Epic material. Now I just need to make mike some mitts, and myself a left hand mitt, and my sewing will be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far today I have been pulled in so many different directions is kind of strange. I dealt with my phone line; returned messages; got paid for my final weeks of work (though I still need to go to the bank); programmed my GPS a bit, and dealt with some AIDS fundraising stuff. So many different things, so little time. I have to get back to work, but before I do, a report on the training that I did, and the fact that I have blisters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I did some training by hiking about ten miles out to Barney Falls again, and climbing bleachers at Cal. Both were tiring, but today I must train more. The hike was really strange because Rachael and I were accompanied by a photographer from the Oakland Tribune. Keep your eyes peeled for the article on April 18th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revisiting the Worst Day of All Time.&lt;br&gt;11 April 2005&lt;/b&gt;
Approximately one year ago today, I received in the mail a form from the DMV that told me that me registration on my Mustang was overdue, and that in addition to the regular fee, I was being charged a late fee. At the time, it was frustrating because I had never been asked for the original fee, and at the time I was rather strapped for money. I eventually went down to the DMV, where, after waiting in line for some time, I learned that I had forgot my wallet. You can imagine how terrible this was on a hot day in LA traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drove home to get it, and calmed down a bit about how frustrating it was that the one time in a very long time that I forgot my wallet, this was the effect. I got back in my hot car, and drove back to the DMV (about a half hour drive, with no traffic). In addition to having traffic, I actually had to wait for a funeral procession to go by. It took a long time, and I had no A/C. In the end, I got the late fee waived, got new stickers for my car, and got on with life, considering it the worst day of all time, which it was at the time. I realize that it doesn&amp;#39;t sound so bad, but there were more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is threatening to be about as bad as that day. For the past month, I have been harassing my dad (also my employer) about getting me my tax forms. Finally, on Saturday, he got them to me. This left me with about five days to get them done - not much time, if any at all really. So today, being the earliest time that I could get them in, I called H&amp;amp;R Block to see what they could do for me. After telling them some information, I came to learn that it looked like I owed about, oh $2,500 by the man&amp;#39;s estimate. About half of what I have saved for the trip. This is not good news, so I decide I should call my dad to give him a piece of my mind, and ask how the hell this happened. He, being the business owner and tax evader that he is, asks me a number of questions, and informs me that I need to get an extension so that his CPA can deal with it when I drive down to San Diego for the Kick Off. Just what I need right now. So, here&amp;#39;s the uncertainty with that: I don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s going to pay that money, or how much it is going to come out to. Probably somewhere around $1,500 is my guess. More than I would like to part with, especially to the war machine. I mean, what would Emerson say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that was pretty bad, but I filed the extension over the phone, agreed to pay a 1% late fee, and got on with life. The next project was to call the DMV about the notice I got last week informing me that, yet again, I had become &amp;quot;delinquent&amp;quot; in my &amp;quot;renewal.&amp;quot; Sigh. here&amp;#39;s the bad news, the car that I failed to renew? I gave it to my dad to sell. He sold it to one of his employees in Mexico. I don&amp;#39;t know who, but it&amp;#39;s down there, being the good Mustang it always was. So. I call the DMV to ask them what to do about the fee I owe on the car I don&amp;#39;t have. The third time I call the number, I don&amp;#39;t get the busy signal, and I actually get through to a phone maze of some sort. After dialing about ten numbers, I get put on hold for a second. Then, I get thrown back into the phone maze, because all operators were busy. So, I go through it again, and get put into the queue. This happens three times. Eventually, I get through to what sounded like a Vietnamese woman that was fresh to America. She barely spoke English, and was quite angry for some reason. Why? I don&amp;#39;t know. Anyway, I asked her what to do. She says, file the Release of Liability Form, REG138. Ok, I say. She notes that it will ask who I sold the car to. Hell. I don&amp;#39;t know who it&amp;#39;s sold to. My dad sold it in Mexico to one of his workers. He probably doesn&amp;#39;t even know my dad anymore. I tell her this, and the jist of what she says is, well, you can&amp;#39;t release liability without that information. I reiterate that I don&amp;#39;t have it, and she tries to hang up on me. I plead, &amp;quot;please, please don&amp;#39;t hang up on me.&amp;quot; Miraculously, she does not. I ask again, what can I do if I don&amp;#39;t know their name? She has no answers, and barely speaks English, so I ask for a supervisor. No luck. She says, I should call the &amp;quot;Registration Control Unit in Sacramento,&amp;quot; and gives me a number, 916.767.8035. Happy, I call the number. She was toying with me. The number has this message, &amp;quot;At the tone, the time will be 2:22 PM Pacific time. Beep.&amp;quot; She literally gave me the number to the universal time place. I am still in shock about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the summary. I owe a couple of grand in taxes. I have a car that is mine, but is owned by somebody else. I can either pay $100 for it every year, or somehow try to find another answer. It&amp;#39;s 3PM. Today has been terrible, but at least I didn&amp;#39;t get stuck behind a funeral procession. Perhaps I hate the DMV. How can it be so bad without people being up in arms? I don&amp;#39;t understand. We live in the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better Today, Thanks for Asking&lt;br&gt;13 April 2005&lt;/b&gt;
Well, it seems that all is well in the world of PCT planning. For some reason, I can&amp;#39;t quite figure out what it is that I should be doing to get ready. It&amp;#39;s possible that I&amp;#39;m entirely ready at this point. I have a few things that I want to shop for, but the pile of gear that is going with me down to San Diego is ready. I can&amp;#39;t really pack for the trip yet because I don&amp;#39;t want to compress my sleeping bag, but all else is ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My roommate Rachael has told me that I should jot down some of my biggest worries for my ever vigilant public. Probably my biggest worries at this point are water worries - that one, I won&amp;#39;t get through the desert without some serious dehydration, and that two, I won&amp;#39;t get through the Sierra Snow like I need to. I have done some thinking about the southern California water situation, and I think the thing to do about it is carry a ton of water, keep your eye on the next water stop, and hope for the best. I figure if I carry six liters, I should have more than enough. Usually that&amp;#39;s cutting it close, but I hear that every creek, crik and rivelet is pumping with water this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to what I am going to do about the snow in the sierras, and, more importantly, the San Gabriels, I think the plan is to hit it like a ton of bricks. It&amp;#39;s not the most brilliant plan, but I think it &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; just work. I think my age might factor into this foolhardy plan. Anyway, we&amp;#39;re going to hit it, and perhaps we&amp;#39;ll break fresh trail. Should be interesting anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other concern that I am harboring at this point is Ken. Ken is my homemade sleeping quilt. I&amp;#39;ve had him for about eight or nine months now, but I&amp;#39;ve been too afraid to really get out with him much. I have been sleeping under him for a good few days now, and I think I can get used to him. If not, I&amp;#39;ll have a Feathered Friends Hummingbird waiting for me at my mom&amp;#39;s house in San Diego, so worst case scenario, I&amp;#39;ll just have her mail me that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all in all, I think I&amp;#39;m in the calm before the storm. It&amp;#39;s possible of course that the storm will never hit, but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it will. Take the following information, and tell me if it adds up nicely: On Friday, I have a going away party in Berkeley. On Saturday, I have one in LA. On Sunday, I have one in San Diego. On Monday, I have a date with my dad&amp;#39;s CPA to do my taxes. Hmmm...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finishing Touches&lt;br&gt;19 April 2005&lt;/b&gt;
Well, things are winding down, and it looks like I am about ready to go now. The bounce box is packed; I have resupply packages set up for Warner Springs, Idyllwild, Wrightwood, Kennedy Meadows, and Ashland; I&amp;#39;ve been on tour for the past few days, and have said goodbye to just about everybody I know; and I&amp;#39;ve done, filed and paid my taxes (grand total with deductions: ~$500).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it seems like everything is a go, I feel somewhat strange. In a few days, I&amp;#39;m going to begin walking. After walking for a few days, I&amp;#39;m going to continue walking. Then, after a few weeks of walking, yes, I am going to walk some more. Eventually, after five months of it, I will stop walking, if and only if I have made it to Canada. Sounds simple, but I get bored easily. I&amp;#39;ve never done anything quite like this before, so I can only guess how my mind and body will react. I&amp;#39;m pretty confident about how my body will react (aside from my ankles and hips), but I know my mind is going to go insane at least temporarily. I was trying to explain to a friend last night about how it will happen when my brain tries to make me quit. I think that at first my brain will tell me that I&amp;#39;m bored. Then it will tell me to quit, that there&amp;#39;s no point in going on if I&amp;#39;m not having fun. Eventually, I will tell it to go away and mind its own business, but it&amp;#39;s harassed me incessently in the past, and it will continue harassing me on and on even after I&amp;#39;ve asked it to leave me alone. The trick is going to be telling it to go away, and remembering all the reasons that I am on the trail - the beauty, the challenge, the isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I have cold feet a little bit right now, but I&amp;#39;m quite excited. I know it will be the trip that defines the next chapters in my life, and I know that I will leave the trip a changed person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next post will be from the trail.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pct"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="me"></category></entry><entry><title>Install Garmin Topo! in Linux</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/02/11/install-garmin-topo-in-linux/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-02-11T22:08:23+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-02-11:posts/2008/02/11/install-garmin-topo-in-linux/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm planning a quick trip out to Yosemite for next weekend, and I wanted to print out a couple of maps from Garmin Topo! beforehand. The last time I used Topo! was about four years ago, when I had Windows XP installed. I don't remember how I installed it then, but that probably means it wasn't too challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, however, I don't have a computer running Windows except for as a virtual client within Ubuntu, so I figured that would be the best place to begin. I booted up Windows XP, popped in the CD, mounted it within the virtual client, and tried to install. No dice: some error message. I played with it for a while, and I eventually decided that for some reason, it just wasn't going to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next idea was to try installing Topo! within Ubuntu via Wine (Wine Is Not an Emulator). Wine is an application that attempts (and often fails, sometimes works) to allow Windows applications a method of working within Linux. I closed down Windows, opened the install CD within Ubuntu, and double-clicked the Setup.exe file. Amazingly, the Windows Install Shield business popped up, and the installation proceeded with no problems whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that was done, the only remaining step was to make myself a nice link/alias/launcher. Once it's installed, the Topo! executable is located at ~/.wine/drive_c/TOPO!/TOPO.EXE, so it's just a matter of making a link to that, and you're all done.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Linux"></category><category term="camping"></category></entry><entry><title>Tune Your Monitor.

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is to be able to take census tracts of land, combine them with population studies, and then to plot the information geographically (as above). The software of choice for places that need closed-source software (such as my work) seems to be ArcGIS, but there are several other open source versions that are free. The two that I've found so far are Grass and QuantumGIS (aka qgis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, Grass is the original, old-skool GIS developed by the military, and Quantum is the up and coming GIS that wants to supplant it. I'll try to come back once I've tried them both, and let people know what I learn. In the mean time, I must say it's exciting to be able to make graphs like these. &lt;/p&gt;

It's a little frustrating from time to time because so many sites have gads of information that search engines just can't get to, which means that you have to rely on the site's search engine, which invariably does not work very well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here's the concept. The search engine creates an opt-in program wherein websites (like banks for example) can give the engine a generic login and password, and then the search engine can get in, crawl the site, make an index, and then get out. Later, when you search for content, you can search for that information, if you desire, but to see it, you'll need to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you are a person who uses the secure site, you can give the search engine the ability to log in as you, and then crawl the site for your information. Thus, if you gave the search engine the login to your bank, you could later search for all your transactions at Cha Cha's restaurant....or whatever. Actually, this might be a privacy concern...but it's a thought.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="google"></category><category term="infotech"></category><category term="concept"></category></entry><entry><title>Taxonomy Features Are Go</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/13/taxonomy-features-are-go/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-13T16:56:44+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-01-13:posts/2008/01/13/taxonomy-features-are-go/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been rather busy since starting this blog many months ago, so I never got to finish rounding out its features.

They can quite easily please one crowd, but they can never please everybody. Back in the good old days, they tried to solve this in restaurants and bars by having a jukebox with a bunch of music stored physically inside it. Now we have jukeboxes that can download music, but that's where the technology seems to have stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's my concept on the theme. You create a website that can only be accessed by those on the Internet caf&amp;eacute;'s wireless router, and you post the address somewhere conspicuous in the caf&amp;eacute;. Next, you allow the people in the caf&amp;eacute; to stream their music through their laptops into a queue where it eventually gets played over the loudspeakers. This way, the people in the caf&amp;eacute; can actually play their own music when they go to the caf&amp;eacute;, share it with others, etc. The caf&amp;eacute; servers would have an override button and volume control and the like, so they can control the masters on the whole ordeal (this would be to prevent the Kenny G lovers of the world). This permission could also be given to certain caf&amp;eacute; members who had proven their good music taste. Actually, giving this permission to all caf&amp;eacute; patrons might work too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this idea could work with a little manipulation, but the question of copyrights will probably come up. My argument would be that the music is being shared non-commercially by the laptop owners, not the caf&amp;eacute;, and that thus no infringements are being made by the caf&amp;eacute;; that this would be no different than a laptop owner bringing speakers into the caf&amp;eacute; and simply sharing their music. This would in turn shield the caf&amp;eacute;'s of the world, leaving the music sharers liable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the counter argument could be made that on a grander scale, what if the speakers brought in were huge, and what if the audience was that of the Superbowl, and not the caf&amp;eacute;? In other words, how is this model different than a Superbowl host playing music during the Superbowl? To this I would respond that the Superbowl is doing it for money, whereas the cafe could arguably say they were doing it just to have good music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final idea behind this would be that the caf&amp;eacute; could keep a database of the music their customers wanted to play, and that they could then know which single songs to actually buy, and to actually own the copyrights for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could almost work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category><category term="concept"></category></entry><entry><title>Cool Research Tip - Bookmark to Date Websites</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/12/28/firefox-last-modified-tip/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-28T13:02:08+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-12-28:posts/2007/12/28/firefox-last-modified-tip/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time researching things on the Internet, and I've noticed a problem with regards to the answers I find.

I finally got it to work, but it wasn't as reliable as I needed it to be. When I looked into the problem, it seemed I just needed a newer computer to run it. Apparently they were serious when they talked about the minimum hardware requirements (who knew?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about just running a lighter-weight piece of software, but after I priced it out, I learned that I could get a new computer (sans monitor, keyboard, speakers, mouse and hard drives) for only $350. So I did. I just finished putting it together* and getting Zimbra working again (which was easy since I used the old hard drives), and now I've got a give away pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One computer, sans hard drive. It's a P3, it's got about a gig of RAM, graphics card, integrated ethernet. The case is a beaut, but it weighs in at about 20 lbs. If you get it a set of matched processors, it's actually kind of fast - &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A P3 processor and heat sink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four SDRAM spacers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two DSL Modems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it. That computer could work well for somebody that does light computing. The rest is probably garbage, but you never know. Any takers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The specs, in case somebody is interested, are meager, but still infinitely faster than the predecessor. The new computer is a Intel Duo, 2.13Ghz ($150), 2GB of RAM ($70) and cheap motherboard with integrated video, sound and ethernet ($40).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="zimbra"></category><category term="computer"></category><category term="hardware"></category></entry><entry><title>Old Versions of Site are Up...sort of...</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/10/11/old-site-is-up-sort-of/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-11T19:04:42+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-10-11:posts/2007/10/11/old-site-is-up-sort-of/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was working on getting the &lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/oldsite" title="Old Site"&gt;old versions&lt;/a&gt; of the site up and going for history's sake, and I have more or less accomplished the task, though I learned a very important lesson in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, I learned that if you want to host additional custom directories on your drupal site, it's a piece of cake: Just make the directories in your drupal directory, and you're done. For example, my drupal directory is at /usr/share/drupal-5.1, so to host a page at michaeljaylissner.com/oldsite, I just made a directory at
/usr/share/drupal-5.1/oldsite, put stuff in it, and was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more important lesson was that when hand-coding HTML, as I did in the previous version of the site, relative links such as /assets/picture1.jpg are &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; the same as relative links such as assets/picture1.jpg. Both work, but only one is actually relative to the current page (the latter one). The former one may as well have been written michaeljaylissner.com/assets/picture1.jpg, because that's what that first slash means. Duh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I never ran into this problem before now. Anyway, if you take the time to check out the old site (which I don't really recommend), you'll find many broken links. This is why.
The other project I have been working on is getting all of my pictures from the old site set up on this site in a place where registered users can find them. This is a work in progress, but if you're a registered user, you might be interested to see them, if you haven't already. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blog"></category><category term="me"></category></entry><entry><title>Zimbra Done.

My main two difficulties when installing Zimbra stemmed from 1) not opening ALL the ports on my router that I needed to, and 2) assorted DNS difficulties mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that it is working reliably though, I'm quite pleased with it, and I've realized that it's so excellent that I am going to have to move all my mail accounts over to it very soon. It has a couple of rather pleasing functions that I'm excited about. The first is LDAP, which allows me to have the same contact list no matter how or where I get my mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, and probably more important feature is Transport Layer Security (TLS) which creates a level of encryption between me and my server so that if an email gets as far as my server without getting eavesdropped upon, it can go that last bit of the journey from the server to me without any worries. This is a feature that for some reason I never had before now, and I'm quite glad to have it, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it's nice to finally have webmail that's good enough that I have to think to myself about whether or not I want to check my mail in Thunderbird or Firefox. What a concept. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="zimbra"></category></entry><entry><title>LoJack for Linux Part II</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/09/25/lojack-on-linux-part-ii/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-25T22:42:45+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-09-25:posts/2007/09/25/lojack-on-linux-part-ii/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;EDIT: See update in the comments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some &lt;a href="http://www.arsgeek.com/?p=1612" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; after that last post, and I learned that the trick to this is to get a free account from dyndns.com, and then use the ddclient in daemon mode. That combination will allow you to track the IP of your computer no matter where it is, no script involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other piece of this puzzle is somewhat more puzzling: How to access the computer after it is stolen. Ideally, this would happen via ssh, but in practice ssh almost always talks over port 22, and routers pretty much always block all ports. The only solution to this problem I can think of is to hack the thief's router once you know its IP address, but that's hardly a solution really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other caveat to consider is that if you need a password to log in, the ddclient won't get started in the first place because the thief won't be able to log in. So, what's the better solution: A password login, or ddclient? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm....any solutions to the ssh problem are more than welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="lojack"></category></entry><entry><title>LoJack for Linux</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/09/23/lojack-for-linux/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-23T14:56:19+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-09-23:posts/2007/09/23/lojack-for-linux/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been spending some time lately shopping for laptops, and I noticed an interesting product on the shelves these days: &lt;i&gt;LoJack for Laptops&lt;/i&gt;. It's an interesting concept, because I think LoJack could do a lot of cool things these days for just about anything you buy that's worth more than a couple hundred bucks. My bike, for example, would be another object I would want LoJack for if the system were cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked out the LoJack installation software, figuring it would inform me that I had to have a GPS chip installed in my laptop for it to work, but to my surprise, it just uses IP addresses. From what I could figure out, it works in two ways. One, it sends your IP address to a centralized server at some regular interval. Two, it allows a back door entrance into your computer so that if your computer is stolen, you can monitor the location of it more closely, bug the new owner, convince them to give it back, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to thinking about this, and from what I can tell, there isn't anything here that a Linux laptop can't easily accomplish. The only tricky part I can think of is the back door thing, because I imagine most routers block incoming traffic on pretty much every port except 80, so ssh'ing into the computer might be tricky even once you know the correct IP to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for determining the external IP, I found &lt;a href="http://linux.byexamples.com/archives/307/what-is-my-public-ip-address/" target="_blank"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;, which pretty much fits the bill. The basic idea is to go to one of the million whatsmyip.com-type websites via command line, and grep the IP out of the code. One hilarious thing I found on there was &lt;a href="http://www.moanmyip.com" target="_blank"&gt;moanmyip.com&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend a visit if you're "visually impaired".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now that the men in the room are good and turned on, the script pretty much needs three more things: 1. A centralized server to collect the IPs, 2. That ssh back door to mess with the thief, and 3. The script itself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updates to come.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Chronicals of installing Zimbra, OR If it looks awesome, it's probably a pain to install.</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/09/14/zimbra-chronicals/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-14T00:24:56+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-09-14:posts/2007/09/14/zimbra-chronicals/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;a href="http://www.redhatxchange.com/Zimbra.html"&gt;check this out&lt;/a&gt;. Use the username 'admin' and the 
password 'zcsadmin'. When you're done there, come back here, 
and pick up where you left off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty sweet right? Calendar functions, ajaxy goodness, tagging, 
searching, etc. Pretty much all you could want from a web email client, 
right? Right. So I figured I'd download and install it. The first thing that
 worried me was that it wasn't in the repositories of Ubuntu software, 
 so it wasn't just a &lt;code&gt;sudo aptitude install zimbra&lt;/code&gt; away. So I 
 downloaded it to &lt;code&gt;/usr/src&lt;/code&gt;, unpacked it, found the install script 
 (&lt;code&gt;install.sh&lt;/code&gt;), and began the magic (&lt;code&gt;cd /usr/src/zsc; sudo ./install
 .sh&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that my CPU overheated about 20 times while downloading 
the Zimbra Suite (apparently it needed thermal grease and a heat sink 
realignment), all went well until the install script got to resolving my MX 
records, hostname, /etc/hosts file, etc. Apparently figuring these out is a 
bloody pain in the ass (forgive the imagery, I mean it in the British sense)
. So for the past few days I've been struggling with getting this figured 
out, and the point of this post is, if you've been sending emails to any 
@michaeljaylissner.com address, I'm ashamed to say, 
they're not going through. But you probably have realized this, 
because they're bouncing back to you. Well, now you know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me a couple more days, I'm working on it. In the mean time, 
the &lt;a href="://michaeljaylissner.com/contact/"&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; link does work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Linux"></category><category term="zimbra"></category></entry><entry><title>This is it. Drupal systems are go.</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/09/12/drupal-is-go/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-12T21:46:59+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-09-12:posts/2007/09/12/drupal-is-go/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I can't say I have had a serious blog before, so with this very sentence, I am forging new ground for myself, and through the strange magic of the Internet, for everybody else in the world (except China, who I will now block from this blog by writing the following word: &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a pressure here of course not to have any typos and to make this post significant and poignant, but if I know me - and I think I do - I shouldn't set high bars like that for myself. I should just enjoy the medium, allow mistakes early and often, and proceed with the reason I am here to write today, which, according to the title of this post is to discuss the software of this very blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an interesting thing setting up a blog in your house. For some reason, it's really bloody complicated. First, you've got to learn how your house is networked, then how the Internet is networked. Once you think you've got that figured out, you have to get a faster Internet connection (cable as opposed to DSL), and if you are feeling spry, perhaps a static IP. I'm not feeling spry, and so, dyndns.com is my friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step once the networking is figured out is to figure out the software and hardware sides of things. This is not an easy task either. In the end, I have set up two computers to run this here blog. One to run Drupal, Apache, etc., and the other to do the mail serving. For the CMS, I have chosen Drupal because it seems to be all the rage, and because it has a stupid song that got caught in my head for far too long (see youtube for details). Drupal is of course running on GNU+Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL. As for the mail server, it would be running Zimbra, but at the moment it is crashed. I can't make it stop overheating, and it's rather annoying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, once that's up and going, everything should be a go, and I will be a proud Internet host. Only one question truly remains: Is my IP on an anti-spam blacklist? We shall soon find out. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blog"></category><category term="me"></category><category term="drupal"></category></entry></feed>
