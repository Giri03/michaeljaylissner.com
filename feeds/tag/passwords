Today, I saw the following alert on my Gmail account, ensuring that this security vulnerability is fixed. I'm often impressed by Gmail, but this is great to see:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hey, this is important: If you ever lose access to your account, you can send password reset info to [myemailaddress@michaeljaylissner.com]. This address is correct | Update this address&lt;/blockquote&gt;What happened in the case of Twitter was that a hacker did the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figured out the Gmail address of a Twitter employee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ForgotPasswd?service=mail&amp;fpOnly=1" target="_blank"&gt;Gmail's password reminder&lt;/a&gt;, and requested a reminder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This informed him that an email reminder was sent to a specific Hotmail address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That Hotmail address had been automatically closed due to disuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He set up that email account, since it was now available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He then requested another password reminder, which summarily sent an email to his new Hotmail account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This gave him complete access to the Twitter employee's gmail account (and thus a lot of other stuff)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new alert that Gmail is now popping up should serve the function of updating this, and, if done correctly, should fix this problem permanently. Well done Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="security"></category><category term="Twitter"></category><category term="gmail"></category><category term="secret questions"></category><category term="passwords"></category></entry></feed>
