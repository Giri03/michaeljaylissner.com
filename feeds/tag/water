After reading &lt;a href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/05/15/meet-my-enemy/"&gt;my post
regarding my hate of Fiji water&lt;/a&gt;, Fiji has responded by &lt;a href="http://www.fijigreen.com"&gt;creating a new 
website&lt;/a&gt; that tries to lure consumers out of their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's great that Fiji Water wants to lower their carbon impact, 
but come on folks. Talk about green-washing. This is just stupid. If you 
care about the environment, stop bottling water in Fiji. Actually, 
just stop bottling water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="environment"></category><category term="water"></category></entry><entry><title>Meet My Enemy</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/05/15/meet-my-enemy/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-15T22:26:41-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2008-05-15:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/05/15/meet-my-enemy/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'd like everybody to meet my new enemy, and that of my girlfriend, 
who is now working against bottled water. Behold Fuji: traveler from 
distant seas, pillager of distant islands, waster of petroleum, 
and emptier of pockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No Alt" src="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/images/Fiji bottle_0.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, not only is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/products?q=fiji+water&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;scoring=p"&gt;Fiji water expensive&lt;/a&gt;, but it also COMES FROM FIJI!!!! 
Think about that for a moment. Fiji is an island in the middle of the 
Pacific. Behold the planet Earth, and the island of Fiji:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=fiji&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=6"&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/images/FijiMap2.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, the water must get from there to here (it's about 5,
500 miles to the bay area). Luckily, the bottle is square so they can fit a
lot of it on a ship, but it must be bottled for weeks and months before it
arrives here. Why are we pillaging this island? It's madness.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="water"></category><category term="environment"></category></entry></feed>
