After reading &lt;a href="http://www.michaeljaylissner.com/blog/meet-my-enemy"&gt;my post regarding my hate of Fiji water&lt;/a&gt;, Fiji has responded by &lt;a href="http://www.fijigreen.com" target="_blank"&gt;creating a new website&lt;/a&gt; that tries to lure consumers out of their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's great that Fiji Water wants to lower their carbon impact, but come on folks. Talk about green-washing. This is just stupid. If you care about the environment, stop bottling water in Fiji. Actually, just stop bottling water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="environment"></category><category term="water"></category></entry><entry><title>Meet My Enemy</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/05/15/meet-my-enemy/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-15T22:26:41+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-05-15:posts/2008/05/15/meet-my-enemy/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'd like everybody to meet my new enemy, and that of my girlfriend, who is now working against bottled water. Behold Fuji: traveler from distant seas, pillager of distant islands, waster of petroleum, and emptier of pockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/Fiji%20bottle_0.preview.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, not only is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/products?q=fiji+water&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;scoring=p" target="_blank"&gt;Fiji water expensive&lt;/a&gt;, but it also COMES FROM FIJI!!!! Think about that for a moment. Fiji is an island in the middle of the Pacific. Behold the planet Earth, and the island of Fiji:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=fiji&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/FijiMap2.preview.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, the water must get from there to here (it's about 5,500 miles to the bay area). Luckily, the bottle is square so they can fit a lot of it on a ship, but it must be bottled for weeks and months before it arrives here. Why are we pillaging this island? It's madness.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="water"></category><category term="environment"></category></entry></feed>
