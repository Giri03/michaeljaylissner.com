This seems like a standard thing to check for, but even in the &lt;a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/3.0b4/"&gt;latest release&lt;/a&gt;, this still hasn't &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129393"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45946"&gt;fixed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was really starting to get out of control for me, so I did some thinking today about how to fix it, and finally came up with an answer. There is &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/2505"&gt;an add-on&lt;/a&gt; that's supposed to do this, but it hasn't been updated in years, and doesn't work on the latest version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's the process that worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your address book, and select the address book that you wish to de-duplicate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Tools &amp;gt; Export, and export the address book as a CSV file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open that file in OpenOffice Spreadsheet, and sort it by the column called "Display Name"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert a column to the left (or right, whatever) of the "Display Name" 
 column, and fill it with entries such as &lt;code&gt;=if(C2=C3, "Duplicate", 
 "OK")&lt;/code&gt; Where C corresponds with the column in which you're looking for 
 duplicates. Fill the entire column with such entries all the way to the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, visually look for duplicates and delete them. Once that's done, do the same thing for the email address column, and you should be able to eliminate all the duplicates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get them back into Thunderbird, go to Tools &amp;gt; Import, and import the file. This will create a new address book by the name of the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From there, simply delete your old address book, and rename the new one to something useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All done!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thunderbird"></category><category term="de-dup"></category></entry></feed>
