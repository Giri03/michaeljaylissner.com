the opportunity to work with a couple of guys on a project aimed at solving
a problem that we have in our society. While perhaps not the greatest 
problem, the one we identified was how to choose music in a public location
that maximally pleases the maximum number of people, and further, 
how to encourage real-world interaction among and between those people. In
other words, how to choose good music, and how to get people to talk to 
each other rather than bury their nose in their computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To long-term readers of this blog, this may sound familiar, 
as &lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/02/public-jukebox-for-internet-cafes/"&gt;I proposed the idea of a democratic music jukebox a while ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the project went quite well. It was a great team, 
and we were able to write several papers explaining how such a system would
work, and what kinds of problems it would solve. We weren't able to really
make the system, however we were able to create a &lt;a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~ryan/i216/jukebox-prototype/jukebox2.php"&gt;wireframe mockup&lt;/a&gt; 
which should give you some idea of what we had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested in the idea, I've attached our &lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/cmc-final.pdf"&gt;final paper&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/cmc-poster.pdf"&gt;poster presentation&lt;/a&gt; to this blog entry. The poster itself is a bit cut up 
so it could be pasted together on poster board. Apologies for that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Computer-mediated Communication"></category><category term="ischool"></category><category term="music"></category><category term="paper"></category></entry><entry><title>A Music Cost Inventory</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/11/22/a-music-cost-inventory/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-11-22T17:21:02+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-11-22:posts/2008/11/22/a-music-cost-inventory/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html"&gt;Title 17, Chapter 5, section 504c2 of the US copyright law&lt;/a&gt;, if you get caught with music that you have downloaded illegally from the Internet, you can get charged up to $150,000 per infringement. I thought I would do a little experiment to see how much I would be in for if my entire collection were to be found to be illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's do some math. I have 3,876 tracks, at $150,000 each. So if my entire collection were to be found illegal, that means it would cost me $581.4 million dollars &amp;mdash; about .6 billion dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, let's assume that I can live with that reality. It just seems odd that I could have bought those songs for $3,876 on amazon.com, or iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something isn't quite right here. Also, did I mention that all US digital music sales &lt;a href="http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_resources/dmr2008.html"&gt;are estimated&lt;/a&gt; to total $2.9B in 2007? That makes my music worth about 20% of the 2007 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category><category term="copyright"></category><category term="IP"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="law"></category></entry><entry><title>Our Poor Great Grandparents</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/11/11/our-poor-great-grandparents/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-11-11T00:50:41+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-11-11:posts/2008/11/11/our-poor-great-grandparents/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's important to have perspective these days. Times are changing, you know, and it can be hard to keep track of how things used to be. In that vein, I found an interesting quote from 1978:&lt;blockquote&gt;Children who begin school today have probably listened to more music than their great grandparents heard in their entire lives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It's pretty hard to imagine music as such a treat, since I listen to it pretty much every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also reminds me of the Stravinky's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring"&gt;Rite of Spring&lt;/a&gt;, which was so raucous that it caused riots. These days people get offended by rap, punk and video games (oh my!), and claim that they make children into little ne'er-do-wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riots though? I can't imagine music causing riots ever again.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category><category term="perspective"></category></entry><entry><title>Music Stats</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/10/08/music-stats/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-10-08T14:35:46+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-10-08:posts/2008/10/08/music-stats/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have this problem when I am listening to music that I almost never choose artists whose name starts with anything after the letter D. When I am browsing for music, I just never get that far in the list. For some time, I've wondered if this is my fault, or if I just have more music in the front of my collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time came to do a little stats work and figure out why this is. Here are the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a strong predominance of the letters A-E, there is also one in the P-T range. This leads me to believe that I should hunt for music in that area more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No Alt" src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/images/Number of Occurances Pentads-img1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I expected A-E to come out ahead, who would have thought that B would have more than 80 artists, almost twice the second most common letter? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No Alt" src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/images/Number of Occurances Pentads-img2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what conclusions does this lead to? One: That I need to look at my music beyond the letter D. Two: That B is a very popular letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those wondering about their own music collection, if you browse to your music folder and run the following, it will tell you how many artists starting with that letter you have. For the example below, it tells me I have 30 artists with the letter 'A'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Music&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a place your mother goes when everybody else is soundly sleeping.
Through the lights of beacon street and if you listen you can hear her weeping, she's weeping, 
Cause the gentlemen are calling and the snow is softly falling on her petticoats,
And she's standing in the harbor and she's waiting for the sailors in the jolly boat. See how they approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With dirty hands and trousers torn they grapple 'til she's safe within 
their keeping.
A gag is placed between her lips to keep her sorry tongue from any speaking, or screaming.
And they row her out to packets where the sailor's sorry racket calls for maidenhead.
And she's scarce above the gunnels when her clothes fall to a bundle and she's laid in bed on the upper deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so she goes from ship to ship, her ankles clasped her arms so rudely 
pinioned
'till at last she's satisfied the lot of the marina's teeming minions, in their opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they tell her not to say a thing to cousin, kindred, 
kith or kin or she'll end up dead.
And they throw her thirty dollars and return her to the harbor where she goes to bed.
And this is how you're fed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So be kind to your mother, though she may seem an awful bother, 
and the next time she tries to feed you collard greens, remember what she does when you're asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9848258-7.html?tag=newsmap"&gt;Amazon 
has started selling mp3's from all four of the major record labels.&lt;/a&gt; It's a 
pretty cool revelation, so I went ahead and checked it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what? Linux users, you are screwed. In order to download albums from 
Amazon, you must "Get the Amazon mp3 downloader"...which is not available for 
Linux. Excuse me? Say what? I have downloaded literally hundreds upon hundreds 
of files from the Internet, and never have I needed a special tool other than 
Firefox. Why now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, if you're going to do something great like this, do it whole hog. 
Don't make me install junkware. After all, I'm &lt;i&gt;choosing&lt;/i&gt; to give you 
money, right? &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category><category term="copyright"></category><category term="amazon"></category><category term="rant"></category></entry><entry><title>Program Idea - Public Jukebox for Internet Cafes</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/02/public-jukebox-for-internet-cafes/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-02T21:32:08+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-01-02:posts/2008/01/02/public-jukebox-for-internet-cafes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The problem with Internet caf&amp;eacute;s as I see it is that they can never 
make everybody happy when it comes to music. They can quite easily please 
one crowd, but they can never please everybody. Back in the good old days, 
they tried to solve this in restaurants and bars by having a jukebox with a
bunch of music stored physically inside it. Now we have jukeboxes that can
download music, but that's where the technology seems to have stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's my concept on the theme. You create a website that can only be 
accessed by those on the Internet caf&amp;eacute;'s wireless router, 
and you post the address somewhere conspicuous in the caf&amp;eacute;. Next, 
you allow the people in the caf&amp;eacute; to stream their music through their
laptops into a queue where it eventually gets played over the loudspeakers. 
This way, the people in the caf&amp;eacute; can actually play their own 
music when they go to the caf&amp;eacute;, share it with others, 
etc. The caf&amp;eacute; servers would have an override button and volume 
control and the like, so they can control the masters on the whole ordeal 
(this would be to prevent the Kenny G lovers of the world). This 
permission could also be given to certain caf&amp;eacute; members who had 
proven their good music taste. Actually, giving this permission to all 
caf&amp;eacute; patrons might work too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this idea could work with a little manipulation, 
but the question of copyrights will probably come up. My argument would be 
that the music is being shared non-commercially by the laptop owners, 
not the caf&amp;eacute;, and that thus no infringements are being made by the 
caf&amp;eacute;; that this would be no different than a laptop owner bringing 
speakers into the caf&amp;eacute; and simply sharing their music. This would in
turn shield the caf&amp;eacute;'s of the world, leaving the music sharers liable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the counter argument could be made that on a grander scale, 
what if the speakers brought in were huge, and what if the audience was 
that of the Superbowl, and not the caf&amp;eacute;? In other words, 
how is this model different than a Superbowl host playing music during the 
Superbowl? To this I would respond that the Superbowl is doing it for 
money, whereas the cafe could arguably say they were doing it just to have 
good music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final idea behind this would be that the caf&amp;eacute; could keep a 
database of the music their customers wanted to play, 
and that they could then know which single songs to actually buy, 
and to actually own the copyrights for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could almost work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category><category term="concept"></category></entry><entry><title>Black Sabbath - Children of the Grave</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/12/30/black-sabbath-children-of-the-grave/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-30T12:28:27+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-12-30:posts/2007/12/30/black-sabbath-children-of-the-grave/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Revolution in their minds

I know this post is going to alienate just about everybody that would ever consider reading my blog, but here's the deal: I want all iPods to support the ogg file format. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For the uninitiated, the ogg format is like the MP3 or the AAC format, except for a couple of very important differences. One, it's free, which is to say that it doesn't belong to some company, and every time I use it I'm not supposed to be giving them a nickel or something. (The MP3 format technically is licensed to the company that created it, so theoretically, every time you buy a computer, MP3 player, etc., you're supposed to give them some quantity of money.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The other reason that I am hereby requesting ogg on my iPod  is because it's better. It sounds better. It compresses better. Are there other metrics that we should be using? None that I know of. I want ogg. Steve Jobs, do you hear me now?! 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, the theoretical argument above holds water, but I have personal reasons for this desire: I have 357 ogg files that I can't listen to on my iPod! This pretty much gives me three choices: One, install &lt;a href="http://www.rockbox.org/" title="Rockbox.org"&gt;Rockbox&lt;/a&gt; on my iPod (I have, it didn't work reliably). Two, convert the ogg files to MP3s (this solution would create inferior-quality songs). Or, three, only listen to those songs on my computer (also a lame solution). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I should also mention while I am on this rant that I have flac files as well. Why doesn't the iPod support those! iPods are great, but these are serious shortcomings.
