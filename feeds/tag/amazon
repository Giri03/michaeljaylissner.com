I didn't realize that two-factor authentication had finally taken off. It's practically vital for your email account (you're asking for trouble without it), but in the past year or so, a bunch of other services have begun offering it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went on a little security binge, and found that I could turn on two-factor authentication at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google/Gmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Schwab (they send you a fob for free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paypal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One note about Charles Schwab is that getting their fob is great, but it's hardly all you should do to secure your account. You should also set up what they call a "verbal password" that you have to provide whenever you call in. Without it, it's pretty easy to get into an account via their surprisingly weak phone security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is a pretty good list so far. The companies are using a handful of different techniques for doing this, but they all seem pretty solid in the end. Google's, naturally, seems to be one of the most robust, but I'm impressed there's so much offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go set these up! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="google"></category><category term="yahoo"></category><category term="dropbox"></category><category term="two-factor authentication"></category><category term="charles schwab"></category><category term="facebook"></category><category term="paypal"></category><category term="amazon"></category></entry><entry><title>Amazon Has mp3's! I Wish I Could Download Them...</title><link href="//michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/22/amazon-has-mp3s/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-22T19:04:40-08:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-01-22:posts/2008/01/22/amazon-has-mp3s/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It made some headlines, and is about to make more during superbowl. 
&lt;a href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9848258-7.html?tag=newsmap"&gt;Amazon 
has started selling mp3's from all four of the major record labels.&lt;/a&gt; It's a 
pretty cool revelation, so I went ahead and checked it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what? Linux users, you are screwed. In order to download albums from 
Amazon, you must "Get the Amazon mp3 downloader"...which is not available for 
Linux. Excuse me? Say what? I have downloaded literally hundreds upon hundreds 
of files from the Internet, and never have I needed a special tool other than 
Firefox. Why now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, if you're going to do something great like this, do it whole hog. 
Don't make me install junkware. After all, I'm &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to give you 
money, right? &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category><category term="copyright"></category><category term="amazon"></category><category term="rant"></category></entry></feed>
