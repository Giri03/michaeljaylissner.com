showing all of my roommates and which room they lived in. I considered 
drawing it out by hand with a charting program, but the idea of updating it
whenever somebody moved in or out seemed daunting, and I decided that the 
best thing would be to make a program that could generate a chart from XML. 
My new job at &lt;a href="http://recommind.com"&gt;Recommind&lt;/a&gt; requires that
I learn and use XSLT, so I took the opportunity to write an XSLT script 
that converts the XML data to HTML, Javascript and SVG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final product looks something like this (anonymized with Presidential 
info for good measure):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/archive/swimlanes/dummy.html"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram" src="/images/swimlane-screenshot.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(click through for complete demo)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the technically inclined: The program is an XSLT script, 
which converts the XML into HTML and Javascript. The Javascript is then 
interpreted by the &lt;a href="http://raphaeljs.com/"&gt;Raphael library&lt;/a&gt;, 
which finally generates the SVG you see. It's overly complex, 
but it was a fun mis-mash of technologies to play with and the point was 
learning new things as much as anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transformation should work to make all kinds of swimlane diagrams, 
so if you're interested in the code, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="XSLT"></category><category term="Raphael"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="Javascript"></category><category term="Fairview"></category></entry></feed>
