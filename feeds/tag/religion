them in oil for a few days to make some bread dip. I had a strange quantity of
virgin oil and fresh peeled garlic on hand, but I lacked the rosemary, so I 
grabbed a friend and went walking in the neighborhood, looking for a garden to&amp;nbsp;rob. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked for a few blocks in the dark with a flashlight looking for rosemary, 
but we weren&amp;#8217;t finding any. We found some mint and some tomatoes in a garden 
near our house, but no rosemary. Then a nice lady walked by with something in 
her hand that looked like a plant. I said, &amp;#8220;Hey, do you know any houses around 
here that might have rosemary?&amp;#8221; She said, &amp;#8220;&amp;#191;necisita rosemary?&amp;#8221; and held 
up the sprig she had in her hand. We chatted a bit, and she gave me a sprig off 
the plant she was bringing&amp;nbsp;home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#8217;m not a religious man, and in fact I don&amp;#8217;t believe in anything that 
can&amp;#8217;t be seen (ghosts, goblins, Zeus, god, angels, et al included). Sometimes 
I can see why others believe though. I mean, what are the&amp;nbsp;odds? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving home, a roommate described it as, &amp;#8220;A modest miracle.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="cooking"></category><category term="religion"></category></entry></feed>
