This made me wonder if I could perhaps fix the problem, so I began playing with all those buttons on my monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to improve things, but until I discovered the images on &lt;a href="http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn't get it quite dialed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually a pretty surprising experience adjusting the monitor at that website. You essentially are shown an image, and asked to adjust one of your settings until the image looks right. It works like a charm, and if your LCD is at all fuzzy, I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="computer"></category><category term="monitor"></category><category term="lcd"></category><category term="tuning"></category></entry></feed>
