For those who don't know what these are, they're great. What they allow you to do is "subscribe" to web sites, so that if the site is updated, you know pretty much immediately. I have about 40 of these subscriptions, which are mostly to friends' blogs, news sites, or some other sites I like to keep track of. It's really convenient: I don't have to monitor some 40 sites, I just check my feed reader, and it will do the legwork for me on all of the sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I digress. One of the feeds I subscribe to is &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars"&gt;Ars Technica, Open Ended&lt;/a&gt;, which is supposed to be their journal of open source news. It's usually top notch news, but I have noticed that occasionally certain open source news items don't make it to into Open Ended. I mentioned this to them yesterday, and today they have created a new RSS feed for open source news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about service. They're officially the bomb. The new feed is &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/oss.rssx"&gt;arstechnica.com/oss.rssx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out. Pretty slick, I must say.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ars technica"></category><category term="open source"></category></entry></feed>
