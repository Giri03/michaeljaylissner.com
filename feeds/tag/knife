&lt;p&gt;I had the occasion to go through airport security over the weekend, 
and I realized an interesting thing. If you want to get through security 
with a large knife, all you have to do is try to slip one through in your 
bag a few times over the course of a few days or weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time you fail, you act like an idiot ("oops!"), 
and give them the knife, proceeding without it to your airplane. Eventually,
the guy watching the x-ray screen will miss the knife, you will proceed, 
and you will finally be able to cut your airplane steak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson by accident when I nearly missed my plane. I had 
planned on checking my small bag with the knife in it, 
but when I arrived at the airport late (my fault), I could either miss my 
plane, or try to sneak the knife through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I didn't want to miss my flight, I tried and succeeded to get the 
pictured knife through. Pretty amazing that a three inch blade can pass 
right by, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if terrorists are patient...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="politics"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="knife"></category></entry></feed>
