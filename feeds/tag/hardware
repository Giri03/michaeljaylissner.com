I finally got it to work, but it wasn't as reliable as I needed it to be. When I looked into the problem, it seemed I just needed a newer computer to run it. Apparently they were serious when they talked about the minimum hardware requirements (who knew?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about just running a lighter-weight piece of software, but after I priced it out, I learned that I could get a new computer (sans monitor, keyboard, speakers, mouse and hard drives) for only $350. So I did. I just finished putting it together* and getting Zimbra working again (which was easy since I used the old hard drives), and now I've got a give away pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One computer, sans hard drive. It's a P3, it's got about a gig of RAM, graphics card, integrated ethernet. The case is a beaut, but it weighs in at about 20 lbs. If you get it a set of matched processors, it's actually kind of fast - &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A P3 processor and heat sink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four SDRAM spacers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two DSL Modems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it. That computer could work well for somebody that does light computing. The rest is probably garbage, but you never know. Any takers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The specs, in case somebody is interested, are meager, but still infinitely faster than the predecessor. The new computer is a Intel Duo, 2.13Ghz ($150), 2GB of RAM ($70) and cheap motherboard with integrated video, sound and ethernet ($40).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="zimbra"></category><category term="computer"></category><category term="hardware"></category></entry><entry><title>A Boring Confession</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/09/29/boring-confession/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-29T16:34:53-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2007-09-29:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/09/29/boring-confession/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I need a heatsink for the mail server.
