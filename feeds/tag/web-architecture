This change meant that links that were previously like this:&lt;blockquote&gt;http://courtlistener.com/scotus/Wong-v.-Smith/&lt;/blockquote&gt;Are now like this:&lt;blockquote&gt;http://courtlistener.com/scotus/&lt;strong&gt;V5o&lt;/strong&gt;/wong-v-smith/&lt;/blockquote&gt;Most of the old links should continue to work, but using the new links should be much faster and more reliable. The major difference between the two is the ID number, which is encoded as a set of numbers (in this case &lt;em&gt;V5o&lt;/em&gt;). This ID corresponds directly with the ID number in our database, aiding us greatly in serving up cases quickly and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time as this change, we added social networking links to all of our case pages to make them easier to share with friends and colleagues. These links use our new tiny domain, &lt;em&gt;http://crt.li/&lt;/em&gt;, and should thus be ideal for websites like Twitter or Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few months we will be getting a major new server, and will be migrating our data to it. This will allow us to serve more data, and&amp;mdash;drum roll please&amp;mdash;will allow us to begin serving audio content on the site. That's right, in the next few months, we will begin getting oral arguments from the circuit courts, and will be serving it directly to you on the case pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have plans to revisit our search interface in order to add date filtering and query building so look for that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we welcome your feedback and support, so don't hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any questions or suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="courtlistener.com"></category><category term="Web Architecture"></category><category term="database"></category></entry><entry><title>Lecturing at UC Berkeley</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/07/30/lecturing-at-uc-berkeley/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-07-30T13:10:56-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2010-07-30:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/07/30/lecturing-at-uc-berkeley/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This summer I've been busy with a number of things. One of them has been 
teaching &lt;a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i153-waim/su10/"&gt;Web Architecture and Information Management&lt;/a&gt; at UC Berkeley 
with two other guys from the School of Information. It's been a TON of work
 for not a whole lot of pay, but it's been really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the three of us split up the work, I only have to do about four 
lectures, but the class is two and a half hours long three times a week, 
which is a lot of talking time. I imagine it's not easy for the students to
 be in the class that frequently either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm giving lectures on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, I've posted my slides for these in the &lt;a href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/projects-and-papers"&gt;projects and 
papers&lt;/a&gt; section of the site. It's definitely true that the best way to 
learn it to teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been learning a little about how to get the class to participate 
and be involved, but that's probably the most challenging part. A lot of 
the students know a lot about the material, and are pretty bored, 
while others are seeing everything for the first time. It makes it pretty 
tricky, but it's working out as the class gets to know each other. We 
started doing student presentations this week, and that has helped 
everybody get a little more skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Web Architecture"></category><category term="teaching"></category><category term="summer"></category><category term="Cal"></category><category term="me"></category></entry></feed>
