handle and cope with real life death, and I found a good quote today. It's 
not exactly about the Internet and death, but it's interesting to think 
about ways the Interne  may have made relationships more complex and how 
that has affected who is socially allowed to grieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=memorializing%20loved%20ones%20on%20the%20world%20wide%20web"&gt;Memorializing Loved Ones on the World Wide 
Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are unwritten but familiar rules, however, about who is entitled to
grieve. Pine, for example, claimed that in "compartmentalized society, 
funerals tend to be limited primarily to the 'proper' bereaved people. This
has helped to create an underclass of grievers whose legitimacy may not 
even be recognized and whose needs are not addressed." Doka (1989) 
identified these individuals as disenfranchised grievers: those whose grief
occurs in relationships with no recognizable kin ties; those whose loss is 
not socially defined as significant; and those who are perceived to be 
incapable of grief (e.g., young children, very old adults, 
mentally-disabled persons)...As relationships become more complex, 
the likelihood of disenfranchised grief and disenfranchised death increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As somebody who has lost a couple of friends over the years that I was 
fairly close to (but not best friends with), this definitely hits home.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="digital death"></category><category term="online grief"></category><category term="mourning"></category></entry></feed>
