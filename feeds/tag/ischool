&lt;p&gt;As of now, I've boiled my classes down to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixing and Remixing Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface Aesthetics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social and Organizational Issues of Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategic Computing and Communications Technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Law and Policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyberlaw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And somehow, I only had to buy three books and four readers this semester, for a total of $315. Somehow, this is more than last semester when I had five books and four readers. Oh well. The books from this semester are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software and Internet Law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro Web 2.0 Mashups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, classes are going well, but at least one of them will need to get cut. It's going to be hard to decide, but luckily I don't have to for another few months.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="ischool"></category><category term="books"></category></entry><entry><title>Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/08/25/ch-ch-ch-ch-changes/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-25T21:02:04+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-08-25:posts/2008/08/25/ch-ch-ch-ch-changes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, we got back from Peru on Sunday (pictures forthcoming), and today was my 
last day at work with the &lt;a href="http://ehsd.org/comm000.html" target="_blank"&gt;Community 
Services Bureau&lt;/a&gt; of Contra Costa County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never worked somewhere for so long - all in all,  it was about three 
years, during which time I progressed from Temp Clerk to Intermediate Clerk 
to Assistant Manager. You do gotta love working in government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, I've been planning on quitting since about December of 2006, when I 
first applied to go back to school. Now that it's a year and a half later, 
I'm surprised I'm not more excited or elated about this change. It's possible 
it hasn't sunk in yet because I have been on vacation for the past two weeks 
(and am used to not going to work), but ultimately, I feel pretty normal, 
which is odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is the first day of school at the &lt;a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu" target="_blank"&gt;Berkeley 
School of Information&lt;/a&gt;. I've got my classes all set up, and I'm shocked at 
exactly how awesome the classes are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the official list as of now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Organization and Retrieval&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributing Computing Applications and Infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Politics of Piracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer Mediated Communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photovoltaic Materials: Modern Technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metrics of Sustainability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of classes, eh? It's 20 units as of now, so I am definitely going to drop a number of them. It's going to be hard to decide which to drop though. It's a three-way split between classes offered through Haas school of business, the Energy and Resources Group and the iSchool. I guess we'll see which float to the top. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="ischool"></category></entry></feed>
