I scoured over the Internet, all the while noticing the perfect little star in my browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of times, I Googled for Firefox icons, but I couldn't find them posted anywhere. Finally, I realized that if I just downloaded the source, I could easily find the icons, zip them up neatly, and post them for all to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's what I've done here. Behold the Firefox icons. These are organized more usefully in the actual Firefox source, but if you don't mind a little icon browsing, the attached zip should have all the icons you see in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
