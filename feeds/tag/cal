One of them has been 
teaching &lt;a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i153-waim/su10/"&gt;Web Architecture and Information Management&lt;/a&gt; at UC Berkeley 
with two other guys from the School of Information. It's been a TON of work
 for not a whole lot of pay, but it's been really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the three of us split up the work, I only have to do about four 
lectures, but the class is two and a half hours long three times a week, 
which is a lot of talking time. I imagine it's not easy for the students to
 be in the class that frequently either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm giving lectures on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, I've posted my slides for these in the &lt;a href="{filename}/papers-and-projects/"&gt;projects and 
papers&lt;/a&gt; section of the site. It's definitely true that the best way to 
learn it to teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been learning a little about how to get the class to participate 
and be involved, but that's probably the most challenging part. A lot of 
the students know a lot about the material, and are pretty bored, 
while others are seeing everything for the first time. It makes it pretty 
tricky, but it's working out as the class gets to know each other. We 
started doing student presentations this week, and that has helped 
everybody get a little more skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Web Architecture"></category><category term="teaching"></category><category term="summer"></category><category term="Cal"></category><category term="me"></category></entry><entry><title>A Decision Has Been Made</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/03/15/a-decision-has-been-made/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-15T00:47:52+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-03-15:posts/2008/03/15/a-decision-has-been-made/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, it wasn't easy to figure this one out, but I have officially chosen to 
go to UC Berkeley. The reasons were many, but what it boiled down to in the 
end were four things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curriculum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reputation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are usually summarized by the acronym PCLR (pronounced "Pickler"). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited about having chosen Cal, though it was a very challenging 
decision. Obviously, my happiness for the next two years was at stake, but 
beyond that, it seems like my entire future was on the table. Check back with 
me in four years, we'll see how I'm doing...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="Cal"></category></entry><entry><title>My Child Is NOT Catholic</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/03/09/my-child-is-not-catholic-dawkins-insists/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-09T10:34:27+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-03-09:posts/2008/03/09/my-child-is-not-catholic-dawkins-insists/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dawkins" src="/images/dawkins.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of going to see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; last night at Cal. 
Although our fourth-row seating probably influenced my judgement, 
I must say he is a truly excellent speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished his book, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; several months ago, 
and I had to agree with a friend who said he was a bit "heavy-handed" in 
the book. So when I went to see him in person, I expected much the same. I 
expected him to push me, to drive his point, to be a little bit too 
aggressive in his delivery. To the contrary though, he is a subtle, 
interesting, humble, and actually quite a funny speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his speech, he engaged in "consciousness raising", 
which he believes worked for feminism, and which he believes will work for 
religion. His example was that as a result of feminist consciousness 
raising, if I say: "All men are created equal", you might think: "Right, 
but what about the women?" He wants to apply this tool to religion, 
so if I say: "A Catholic child", you think: "Children aren't Catholics - 
They're too young to know where they stand on such issues." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believes (and I must agree) that religion in the world has brought much 
violence and destruction, and that the whole thing could be cut off at the 
stem if we all realized that our children do not share our religion. I'm 
simplifying and combining several of his points, but that was really the 
thrust of his speech. If I am a catholic, that does not make my child a 
catholic; I a Muslim, does not make my child a Muslim. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To drive his point home, Dawkins showed a picture that he said he found on 
the Christmas cover of the UK's &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/"&gt;Telegraph Newspaper&lt;/a&gt;. In the picture, 
were three children sitting side by side in costume for some Christmas event
(I think they were the three wise men or some such). The idea behind the 
picture was to depict religious harmony. To quote his book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Christmas-time one year my daily newspaper, the Independent, 
was looking for a seasonal image and found a heart-warmingly ecumenical one
at a school nativity play. The Three Wise Men were played by, 
as the caption glowingly said, Shadbreet (a Sikh), 
Musharraf (a Muslim) and Adele (a Christian), all aged four. Charming? 
Heart-warming? No, it is not, it is neither; it is grotesque. [...] Imagine 
an identical photograph, with the caption changed as follows: "Shadbreet (a 
Keynesian), Musharaff (a Monetarist) and Adele (a Marxist), 
all aged four." Wouldn't this be a candidate for irate letters of protest? 
It certainly should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say that I'm one to really get "irate" about such things, 
but he really does have a point. The number of people that grow up to be the
same religion as their parents is astounding. How can it be that the 
religion of all peoples' parents around the world just happens to be the 
right one for their children? It defies logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Dawkins believes that if we raise consciousness in a similar way to 
feminism, and find a way to allow children to be nontheists until they are 
old enough to make such decisions on their own, we might just be able to 
beat thi  religion thing. We might be able to curb religious violence by 
allowing children to make their own choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could work, and I for one am officially convinced that I will not let 
people speak of religious children. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="atheism"></category><category term="Cal"></category></entry></feed>
