At CourtListener, for example, we make URLs with ID numbers in them that are formed by converting an ID number to letters (so a &amp;rarr; 1, b &amp;rarr; 2, 27 &amp;rarr; A, etc). Higher numbers create longer strings of letters, so over time, this creates curse words in the URL. Currently, the site is only has a few four letter strings, but I will rue the day when any of the &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Seven_dirty_words"&gt;seven dirty words&lt;/a&gt; is being shown to users on my site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many lists of curse words on the web, but none that is maintained or curated. Having that alone would be a useful project. What would make it better would be libraries in popular programming languages that efficiently told you if a string contained a curse word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next feature would be to add additional languages, and then to add words like pen1s, which aren't normally curse words, but are certainly words you'd want to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'd be a pretty simple project, so I may just go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only question is, what do I name it?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Project idea"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="cursing"></category></entry></feed>
