solutions. One problem I've run into many times throughout the years is that
the feeds I have in Google Reader are largely dead, and there's no way to get
rid of the ones that are no longer updated or simply gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/mlissner/trim-my-feeds/overview"&gt;So I built a tool.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out on BitBucket and give it a whirl. It'll go through an OPML file, 
check all the feeds in it, and make a new file for you that has them cleaned
 out. In my case, it purged about 20% of the feeds I had -- a big improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a simple tool, but look, if your friend hasn't updated their blog in 
two years...they're probably not going to. If the feed is gone, you no longer 
need it cluttering your life. If a feed has been redirected, you should fix 
that in your reader! Little things, right?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="trim"></category><category term="opml"></category><category term="open source"></category><category term="google reader"></category><category term="exodus"></category></entry></feed>
