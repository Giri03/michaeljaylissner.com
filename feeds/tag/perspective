Times are changing, you know, and it can be hard to keep track of how things used to be. In that vein, I found an interesting quote from 1978:&lt;blockquote&gt;Children who begin school today have probably listened to more music than their great grandparents heard in their entire lives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It's pretty hard to imagine music as such a treat, since I listen to it pretty much every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also reminds me of the Stravinky's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring"&gt;Rite of Spring&lt;/a&gt;, which was so raucous that it caused riots. These days people get offended by rap, punk and video games (oh my!), and claim that they make children into little ne'er-do-wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riots though? I can't imagine music causing riots ever again.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category><category term="perspective"></category></entry></feed>
