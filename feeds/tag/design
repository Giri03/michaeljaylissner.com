Last night I finally finished the last of them, so today I'm moving on to the design of the site. Design is always much better when people work in a team, so I'm putting these designs here so others can look at them and give me feedback. Please, please do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I've sketched out four of the major pages that the site will have. A user's will begin using the site on its homepage. Here, they will be given few options. Basically, they can login, register for an account, make a search, or read one of the ancillary pages such as the "About" or "Privacy" page:
&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/DSC02180%20(Modified).800x600.preview.JPG"&gt;
Also, note the advanced button under the search field. When this is clicked, it expands to show the advanced search queries that the site will support, as you can see on the next page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people are logged in, their homepage becomes the "Create new alert page," which you can see below. For now, this allows users to create very complicated queries by hand. In the future, it would be nice to build their queries for them. By default, the advanced section will be collapsed, but in the wire frame, I sketched it out. Also, if users click on "More details," (in the bottom-right of the "Advanced" box) they can get explanations and examples of all the connectors shown.
&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/DSC02183%20(Modified).800x600.preview.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that page, they would normally be redirected to their settings page, where their alerts are listed. Here, they can edit and see their alerts.
&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/DSC02185%20(Modified).800x600.preview.JPG"&gt;
Clicking the "Edit" button takes a user back to the "create alert" page, except that it will be pre-filled with the alert they're trying to edit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, users can also edit their profile by clicking on the settings link on the top of every page . This page isn't too special, though it does have a couple unusual features, such as the bar memberships the user is a part of and whether they prefer HTML or plain text emails (not shown in the below version - sorry).

&lt;p&gt;And that's it for now. I'd LOVE any feedback anybody has on these. Typing this up, I've already come across a couple problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users currently get to their alerts by clicking settings - that ain't intuitive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The about page is pretty hard to find. It may need more emphasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are more problems I'm not seeing. That's why I need your help. What am I missing? What should I change? What's stupid? What's outmoded?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="wire frame"></category><category term="Final Project"></category><category term="Design"></category></entry><entry><title>More Security Papers: Breaking ReCAPTCHA and Proactive Methods for Secure Design</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/12/12/more-security-papers-breaking-recaptcha-and-proactive-methods-for-secure-design/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-12-12T12:07:58+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-12-12:posts/2009/12/12/more-security-papers-breaking-recaptcha-and-proactive-methods-for-secure-design/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two more security papers today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first, &lt;em&gt;Breaking ReCAPTCHA&lt;/em&gt; I discuss a few methods that ReCAPTCHAs can be hacked, and talk a bit about the ways that they were attacked by the Anonymous hacker group. I should mention at the outset that none of the approaches here are particularly useful though, and that ultimately, the hacker group beat ReCAPTCHA by simply out numbering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second paper is a brief discussion of some approaches an organization might take when beginning a project in which security is a high concern. Essentially, it takes a chronological approach, from the start to the end of the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="security"></category><category term="captcha"></category><category term="ReCAPTCHA"></category><category term="Design"></category></entry></feed>
