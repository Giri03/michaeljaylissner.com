The regular map for this area doesn't have any distance markers on it, so these are based on talking with the ranger in the park. He seemed knowledgeable, so these numbers are probably the best we'll get for a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If somebody discovers that the rangers in Snow Mountain finally have firm distances, let me know what they are, and I'll happily update this map. Until then, attached is the map as both an SVG and a png. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="backpacking"></category><category term="snow mountain"></category><category term="maps"></category><category term="cartography"></category></entry></feed>
