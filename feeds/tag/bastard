The bastards stole my identity. They somehow got my credit 
card number, address, phone number, etc, took them, and put them to use. Grand 
total losses: $309. Not too bad, considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've called my credit card company, and they promise to reimburse me for my 
losses. This is when I thank the federal government for making them do this. 
Thank you feds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about how this happened, and I have a theory. I am about 95% sure 
this happened as a result of shopping for car parts online. One of the 
retailers I went to (lost to me now) decided to share my contact information 
with a number of "partners" so that a part I was looking for could be found 
more easily. I ended up getting the part, but I think they might have shared 
more info than they should have. Arg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of the services that credit cards have tried to sell me over the 
years to protect me from this kind of thing, I'm happy to say that I'm fine 
without them. It's really not the end of the world...it's annoying though, yes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rant"></category><category term="theft"></category><category term="bastard"></category><category term="identity"></category><category term="security"></category></entry></feed>
