like this: You want to start a new project studying &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; dump of 
data, and you have a great idea of how to do &lt;strong&gt;Y&lt;/strong&gt; with it. You 
go download the data, but then you spend hours (days and weeks) manipulating 
it, manicuring it, and stuffing it neatly into a database. The problem is that 
the data is in &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; format, and they probably haven't told you much 
about it, much less put it into a useful format for other people. You have no 
option but to figure it out, optimize it, make it queryable, etc, when really, 
what you wish you were doing was simply &lt;em&gt;working with it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the data format and quality keeps you from working with the 
data itself. I've run into this a number of times, most notably when trying to 
work with the &lt;a href="http://www.recovery.gov/FAQ/Pages/DownLoadCenter.aspx"&gt;Recovery 
Data&lt;/a&gt;. I've also had fun working with &lt;a href="http://census.gov"&gt;census 
data&lt;/a&gt;, geographic data, and the list goes on. There are any number of useful 
data sources that are provided by non-profits and government bodies, such as 
population, economic, health, and agricultural data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem is simple. A community needs to be built around 
curating the data and providing it in useful formats, and a repository of some 
sort needs to be made so people can download &lt;em&gt;and install&lt;/em&gt; the data. 
Similar ideas have come up a few times in various formats. Most notably, 
Google has taken a stab at solving this with their &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/home" 
target="_blank"&gt;public data sets&lt;/a&gt;, and back around the turn of the 
millennium, Debian &lt;a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=38902" 
target="_blank"&gt;considered making a repository&lt;/a&gt; for the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of these solutions are good enough though. In Google's case, they're 
providing a one-way street: They choose the data source, they tune-up the 
data, and they provide the data. If there's a source you don't like, or if 
it's in a format you don't like, well, too bad. In the case of Debian, they 
decided not to go for it, but they should have. They had the right idea, but 
weren't prepared to give the idea its due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right solution will be one in which the community can suggest and debate 
data sources, and which treats the data with the respect it deserves. I think 
we'll see a data source like this eventually, but I fear that until we do, 
researchers around the world will be stuck doing unnecessary data 
transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="recovery"></category><category term="Project idea"></category><category term="debian"></category><category term="data"></category><category term="curation"></category></entry></feed>
