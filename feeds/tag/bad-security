"No problem" I thought to myself, "I'll just edit my information, surely I put in the wrong birthday."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into the member section, and (after giving them my password for the second time in two minutes) found where my birthday was listed as "on file." I clicked the edit button for that section, and in the resulting page, it again said that my birthday was "on file." It did not give me a way to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering how to change it, I decided to try the help tool. I searched for "change birthday," which gave me the response:&lt;blockquote&gt;Q: Why can't I change my birthdate, and why does it say, "on file"?
A: We use your birthdate as a security measure in case you forget your password. We would not be able to do so if you were able to change it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Great. Good work guys.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="yahoo"></category><category term="bad security"></category></entry></feed>
