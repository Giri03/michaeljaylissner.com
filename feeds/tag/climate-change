2100 West End Avenue, Suite 260
Nashville, TN 37203&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29 December 2008&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Gore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applaud your efforts towards educating the world on the subject of 
anthropogenic climate change, and I congratulate you on your Nobel Prize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write today to urge you to adopt a more open copyright on your materials. 
From what I can deduce, you are relying on the standard American copyright 
for your movie, presentations and books. As a lawyer, 
I am sure you are aware that this copyright system gives you incredible 
strength to protect the fruit of your efforts, however for many people, 
this system hampers their access to reading your books, 
watching your movie, or enjoying your presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and the IPCC have been recognized as the greatest laborers towards 
educating the world on this subject, and I understand if you have taken the 
traditional route with your work. Recently however, as I began purchasing 
the third copy of your movie to give away to a friend, 
I couldn't help but think about how great it would be if it were simply 
streamed from your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many options for creating a more open copyright system, 
and I hope you will take the time to consider the implications of your 
current method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
