Part of that feature is going to be some basic information about the courts themselves, so I spent some time over the weekend researching courts that served a special purpose but were since abolished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such court was the &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Emergency_Court_of_Appeals"&gt;Emergency Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;. It was created during World War II to set prices, and, naturally, was the court of appeals for many cases. The creation date of the court is prominently published in various places on the Internet, but the abolishment history of the court was very difficult to find. After researching online for some time, and learning that my library card had expired (sigh), I put in a query with the &lt;a href="http://www.loc.gov"&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt;, which provides free research of these types of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a couple days, the provided me with this amazing response, 
 which I'm sharing here, and on the above Wikipedia article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated in the Legislative Notes to 50 U.S. Code Appendix § 921 to 926, 
as posted at http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50a/usc_sec_50a_00000921----000-notes.html, 
the following explanation is given regarding the amendment and repeal of Act 
of Jan. 30, 1942, ch. 26, title II, § 204, 56 Stat. 23, 31-33: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Section 924, acts Jan. 30, 1942, ch. 26, title II, § 204, 
56 Stat. 31; June 30, 1944, ch. 325, title I, § 107, 58 Stat. 639; June 30, 
1945, ch. 214, § 6, 59 Stat. 308; July 30, 1947, ch. 361, title I, § 101, 
61 Stat. 619; June 25, 1948, ch. 646, § 32(a), 62 Stat. 991; May 24, 1949, 
ch. 139, § 127, 63 Stat. 107, authorized review of orders of the Office of 
Price Administrator under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 
and created the Emergency Court of Appeals for this purpose. The Emergency 
Price Control Act of 1942 terminated on June 30, 1947, 
under the provisions of act July 25, 1946, ch. 671, § 1, 
60 Stat. 664. The Housing and Rent Act of 1948, act Mar. 30, 1948, ch. 161, 
62 Stat. 93, classified to section 1881 of this Appendix, 
continued the Court for the purpose of reviewing recommendations of local 
advisory boards for the decontrol or adjustment of maximum rents. Later, 
the Defense Production Act of 1950, act Sept. 8, 1950, ch. 932, 
64 Stat. 798, classified to sections 2061 to 2166 of this Appendix, 
continued the Court to review regulations and orders relating to price 
control. The Housing and Rent Act of 1948 and the Defense Production Act of 
1950 both terminated, however, the Court remained in existence "to complete 
the adjudication of rights and liabilities incurred prior to their 
termination dates." (Transcript of Proceedings of the Final Session of the 
Court, 299 F.2d 1.) The final decision of the Court, Rosenzweig v. General 
Services Administration, 1961, 299 F.2d 22, was decided on Dec. 6, 
1961. A petition for rehearing was denied on Jan. 2, 1962, 
and a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United 
States was denied on Mar. 19, 1962, 82 S. Ct. 830. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order of Chief Judge Albert B. Maris, set forth in 299 F.2d 20, 
provided: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business of this Court having been completed, it is ordered that at the
expiration of 30 days from this date, if a petition for certiorari has not 
been filed in the Supreme Court in Case No. 676 [Rosenzweig v. General 
Services Administration], just decided, the acting clerk shall deliver the 
records and papers of the Court in his office to the General Services 
Administration for permanent custody as records of the Government, 
and shall thereupon inform the Chief Justice of the United States that the 
work of the Court has been completed and that the designations of the judges
 of the Court may therefore appropriately be terminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a petition for certiorari is filed in Case No. 676 this order shall take
effect and be carried out at the expiration of 30 days after the final 
disposition of Case No. 676.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the terms of this order, the petition for certiorari 
having been filed, and denied Mar. 19, 1962, the Court terminated on Apr. 18, 1962." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty fantastic research. And for free!

&lt;p&gt;While working on the exam, I have found some real legal gems today. These 
kinds of things don't often turn up unless you know to look for them, and 
since I'm betting nobody ever looks, I figured I'd share them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, a warm up. May I present the laws that protects the &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000706----000-.html"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00220506----000-.html"&gt;The Olympics&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or, perhaps the ones that define and protect (sort of) America's &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000301----000-.html"&gt;anthem (Star Spangled Banner)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000302----000-.html"&gt;motto ("In God we trust")&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000303----000-.html"&gt;floral emblem (the rose)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000304----000-.html"&gt;march (Stars and Stripes Forever)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000305----000-.html"&gt;tree (the mighty oak)&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe you'd prefer a &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sup_01_36_06_I_08_A_10_1.html"&gt;list of the national observances&lt;/a&gt; that are codified by law, such as the May, the &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000139----000-.html"&gt;Steelmark month&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, those laws that &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sup_01_36_06_I_08_A_10_5.html"&gt;govern the inauguration&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000504----000-.html"&gt;the regulations of the electricity&lt;/a&gt; that day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America, sometimes you have the strangest laws.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="law"></category><category term="patriotism"></category><category term="red cross"></category><category term="olympics"></category></entry><entry><title>An Analysis of FTC Behavioral Advertising and an End of Semester Countdown</title><link href="://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/04/02/analysis-of-ftc-behavioral-advertising/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-04-02T14:44:40-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:,2009-04-02:://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/04/02/analysis-of-ftc-behavioral-advertising/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's coming down to the end of the semester, and after I finished &lt;a href="://michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/ftc.pdf"&gt;the 
attached paper&lt;/a&gt; on FTC laws as the apply to online advertising, 
I did some calculations to figure out what I have to do still. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out I have 68-95 pages to write (give or take), 
and two projects to complete between today and early May. Things are going 
to get interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lay of the land looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two law/policy papers - total of 35-50 pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One sociology paper - 25-35 pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A final project combining some aesthetics work I have been doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two technology strategy assessments - total of eight pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And an online project - watch for this soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I'll reserve my thoughts on the attached analysis, but I tried to analyze the ways that the FTC regulates online advertising...within an eight page limit. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="principles"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="paper"></category><category term="law"></category><category term="FTC"></category><category term="advertising"></category></entry><entry><title>A Music Cost Inventory</title><link href="://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/11/22/a-music-cost-inventory/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-11-22T17:21:02-08:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:,2008-11-22:://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/11/22/a-music-cost-inventory/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html"&gt;Title 17, Chapter 5, section 504c2 of the US copyright law&lt;/a&gt;, if you get caught with music that you have downloaded illegally from the Internet, you can get charged up to $150,000 per infringement. I thought I would do a little experiment to see how much I would be in for if my entire collection were to be found to be illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's do some math. I have 3,876 tracks, at $150,000 each. So if my entire collection were to be found illegal, that means it would cost me $581.4 million dollars &amp;mdash; about .6 billion dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, let's assume that I can live with that reality. It just seems odd that I could have bought those songs for $3,876 on amazon.com, or iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something isn't quite right here. Also, did I mention that all US digital music sales &lt;a href="http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_resources/dmr2008.html"&gt;are estimated&lt;/a&gt; to total $2.9B in 2007? That makes my music worth about 20% of the 2007 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category><category term="copyright"></category><category term="IP"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="law"></category></entry></feed>
