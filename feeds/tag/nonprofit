I started at the nearby university, thinking that I might be able to convince some kind professor to teach me some things. When that failed, I tried searching google for nonprofits that looked interesting. Failing that, I went on a limb, and asked a professor of mine if he had any ideas (he did, but they fell&amp;nbsp;through). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after all this time, one fell in my lap.  Last week, I was looking for a place where I could donate my &lt;a href="http://www.michaeljaylissner.com/blog/new-computer-and-give-away-pile"&gt;old computer hardware&lt;/a&gt;, and I discovered the &lt;a href="http://www.accrc.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Alameda County Computer Recycling Center&lt;/a&gt;. It looks pretty darned cool. I will spend my time putting together old computers into useful devices, and then installing Ubuntu or Suse. In exchange, they will give computers (for free) to needy&amp;nbsp;parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not helping the homeless, but it should be educational for me and, ultimately for them. Plus, it will help to keep e-waste out of&amp;nbsp;landfills.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Linux"></category><category term="computer"></category><category term="nonprofit"></category><category term="recycling"></category></entry></feed>
