&lt;p&gt;It's a simple site. You put in a name, and if it has that person in its database, it gives you their age, middle name, and family members. So far, I haven't found any names it &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this information, I went and checked a friend's gmail secret question, which was, "What is your father's middle name?" I just happened to have that information from uspublicrecords.com, so I put it in, and changed their email password.* &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty creepy how easy this is, and fixing this problem could take days as you check all your secret questions one by one. This might make a good mashup: a system for checking all your secret questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now might be a good time to go change your secret questions, cause if it has anything to do with middle names, that site will hand them right out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With their OK, of course.&lt;/li&gt;
