&lt;p&gt;After my last post on this topic, we discovered that although we had already blocked cases from appearing in the search results of all major search engines, we had a privacy leak in the form of our computer-readable sitemaps. These sitemaps contain links to every page within a website, and since those links contain the names of the parties in a case, it's possible that a Google search for the party name could turn up results that should be hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was problematic, and as of now we have changed the way we serve sitemaps so that they use the noindex X-Robots-Tag HTTP header. This tells search crawlers that they are welcome to read our sitemaps, but that they should avoid serving them or indexing them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="sitemaps.xml"></category><category term="privacy"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="courtlistener.com"></category></entry></feed>
