interesting paper&lt;/a&gt; written by some Microsoft engineers on the subject of 
the futures of darknets and illicit file sharing on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty interesting stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...the darknet will be a competitor to legal commerce. From the point of 
view of economic theory, this has profound implications for business strategy: 
for example, increased security (e.g. stronger DRM systems) may act as a
disincentive to legal commerce. Consider an MP3 file sold on a web site: this 
costs money, but the purchased object is as useful as a version acquired from 
the darknet. However, a securely DRM-wrapped song is strictly less attractive: 
although the industry is striving for flexible licensing rules, customers will 
be restricted in their actions if the system is to provide meaningful security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems so obvious, yet...this paper was written several years ago. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="microsoft"></category><category term="DRM"></category><category term="darknet"></category></entry></feed>
