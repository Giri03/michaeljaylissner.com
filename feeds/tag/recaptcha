&lt;p&gt;In the first, &lt;em&gt;Breaking ReCAPTCHA&lt;/em&gt; I discuss a few methods that ReCAPTCHAs can be hacked, and talk a bit about the ways that they were attacked by the Anonymous hacker group. I should mention at the outset that none of the approaches here are particularly useful though, and that ultimately, the hacker group beat ReCAPTCHA by simply out numbering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second paper is a brief discussion of some approaches an organization might take when beginning a project in which security is a high concern. Essentially, it takes a chronological approach, from the start to the end of the project. &lt;/p&gt;
