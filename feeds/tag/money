It&amp;#8217;s pretty&amp;nbsp;shocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here&amp;#8217;s a fact from the article: The Dow Jones had its biggest June loss since the great&amp;nbsp;depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another: The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; stock market has lost $2.1 trillion in value this year - $1.4 trillion in June&amp;nbsp;alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For perspective that&amp;#8217;s 15.2% of the &lt;a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/us.html" target="_blank"&gt;2007 estimated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="money"></category></entry><entry><title>The $10,000 scam.</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/10/16/the-10000-dollar-scam/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-16T23:53:44+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-10-16:posts/2007/10/16/the-10000-dollar-scam/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the concept: You get a 0.0% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APR&lt;/span&gt; credit card, and you see how high of a limit they&amp;#8217;ll give you. You wait for the balance transfer checks to arrive in a week or two, and you write yourself a check for the amount of the credit limit. You invest that money for as long as the card remains at 0.0% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APR&lt;/span&gt;. When that period is up, you pay off the card, and the game&amp;nbsp;ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, that was a total of $10,000, and one year, so if I find a place to invest that $10,000 at, say, 5%, I make $500 over the course of a year, all at no&amp;nbsp;cost.&amp;sup1;&amp;nbsp;&amp;sup2;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here&amp;#8217;s where things get a bit tricky&amp;#8230;I&amp;#8217;m not satisfied with 5%, so I decided to invest it in a mutual fund, half as an experiment, half cause the odds were indeed in my favor. My risk was doing well&amp;#8230;I was up&amp;#8230;and then, this happened with no&amp;nbsp;explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/files/images/chrtsrv.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any ideas out there as to what happened? I still have six months before I have to pay Visa back, but nevertheless, this is&amp;nbsp;annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;sup1;If you don&amp;#8217;t read footnotes, this game is not for you.
&amp;sup2;Two things to bear in mind here. One is to get a card with no balance transfer fees. The other is that your credit score will take a temporary hit during this ordeal (but I have it on good authority that it will recover quickly).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="money"></category></entry></feed>
