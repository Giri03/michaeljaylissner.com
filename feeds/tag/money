It's pretty shocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here's a fact from the article: The Dow Jones had its biggest June loss since the great depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another: The U.S. stock market has lost $2.1 trillion in value this year - $1.4 trillion in June alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For perspective that's 15.2% of the &lt;a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/us.html"&gt;2007 estimated GDP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="money"></category></entry><entry><title>The $10,000 scam</title><link href="http://mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/10/16/the-10000-dollar-scam/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-16T23:53:44+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2007-10-16:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/10/16/the-10000-dollar-scam/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's the concept: You get a 0.0% APR credit card, and you see how high of
a limit they'll give you. You wait for the balance transfer checks to 
arrive in a week or two, and you write yourself a check for the amount of 
the credit limit. You invest that money for as long as the card remains at 
0.0% APR. When that period is up, you pay off the card, and the game ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, that was a total of $10,000, and one year, 
so if I find a place to invest that $10,000 at, say, 5%, 
I make $500 over the course of a year, all at no cost.&amp;sup1;&amp;nbsp;&amp;sup2;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here's where things get a bit tricky...I'm not satisfied with 5%, 
so I decided to invest it in a mutual fund, half as an experiment, 
half cause the odds were indeed in my favor. My risk was doing well...I was
up...and then, this happened with no explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="/images/chrtsrv.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any ideas out there as to what happened? I still have six months before I 
have to pay Visa back, but nevertheless, this is annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;sup1; If you don't read footnotes, this game is not for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;sup2; Two things to bear in mind here. One is to get a card with no balance
transfer fees. The other is that your credit score will take a temporary 
hit during this ordeal (but I have it on good authority that it will 
recover quickly).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="money"></category></entry></feed>
