&lt;p&gt;For the record people, these are bad. They imply that there is some circular relationship about your data points. They are line graphs made into a circle. If you want to indicate the volume under a curve, make a line graph, fill the area under your curve, and then consider it done. Don't use these unless your data points progress from A &amp;rarr; B &amp;rarr; C and then back to A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT: I should add - don't use line graphs for things that don't progress from A to B to C either. For those things, use bar graphs, or column graphs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="bad statistics"></category><category term="visualizations"></category></entry><entry><title>Piracy "Costs"</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/10/08/piracy-costs/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-10-08T14:12:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-10-08:posts/2008/10/08/piracy-costs/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ars Technica has a &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/dodgy-digits-behind-the-war-on-piracy.ars/1"&gt;good article today&lt;/a&gt; about the costs of piracy where they debunk (in four glorious pages) two figures that are often cited to explain just how bad the piracy problem has become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've done an excellent job showing that the figures are absolutely bogus, but their conclusion really makes quite a point. For reference, the first figure is that 750,000 jobs have been lost due to piracy, and the second is that piracy costs $200-$250 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a quote from the conclusion, after they have debunked both of the numbers:&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither figure is terribly plausible on its face. As Wired noted earlier this week, 750,000 jobs is fully 8 percent of the current number of unemployed in the United States. And $250 billion is more than the combined 2005 gross domestic revenues of the movie, music, software, and video game industries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm...sounds like these numbers might be a bit exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="piracy"></category><category term="bad statistics"></category></entry></feed>
