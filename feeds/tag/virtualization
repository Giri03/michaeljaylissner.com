It's been an interesting experience, but I am shocked at the size of XP. After installing it, updating it, installing Firefox and AVG antivirus, it is 5.13GB in size! Incredible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to Fedora 6, which weighs in at 2.57GB (with server and programming software), or - hilariously - with Windows 98 at 230MB (roughly a 20th of XP). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew XP was big, but that's quite something. Something else that was quite interesting is that it took nearly as long to install 98 despite its puny size. I'm baffled as to how it took so long, but I'm guessing it had something to do with multiple processors, which I'm sure it doesn't support.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="microsoft"></category><category term="virtualization"></category></entry></feed>
