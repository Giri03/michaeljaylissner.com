One of them has been 
teaching &lt;a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i153-waim/su10/"&gt;Web Architecture and Information Management&lt;/a&gt; at UC Berkeley 
with two other guys from the School of Information. It's been a TON of work
 for not a whole lot of pay, but it's been really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the three of us split up the work, I only have to do about four 
lectures, but the class is two and a half hours long three times a week, 
which is a lot of talking time. I imagine it's not easy for the students to
 be in the class that frequently either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm giving lectures on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, I've posted my slides for these in the &lt;a href="//michaeljaylissner.com/projects-and-papers"&gt;projects and 
papers&lt;/a&gt; section of the site. It's definitely true that the best way to 
learn it to teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been learning a little about how to get the class to participate 
and be involved, but that's probably the most challenging part. A lot of 
the students know a lot about the material, and are pretty bored, 
while others are seeing everything for the first time. It makes it pretty 
tricky, but it's working out as the class gets to know each other. We 
started doing student presentations this week, and that has helped 
everybody get a little more skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Web Architecture"></category><category term="teaching"></category><category term="summer"></category><category term="Cal"></category><category term="me"></category></entry></feed>
