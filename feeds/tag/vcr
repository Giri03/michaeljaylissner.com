I knew I always liked this guy. Too bad he couldn't live forever. This quote is a bit dated, but the point is still good. It also helps to imagine his voice before reading this:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the "Neighborhood" at hours when some children cannot use it. I think that it's a real service to families to be able to record such programs and show them at appropriate times. I have always felt that with the advent of all this new technology that allows people to tape the "Neighborhood" off-the-air, and I'm speaking for the "Neighborhood" because that's what I produce, that they then become much more active in the programming of their family's television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been "You are an important person just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions." Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is important.&lt;/blockquote&gt;You tell them Mr. Rogers. You tell 'em.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="copyright"></category><category term="VCR"></category><category term="IP"></category></entry></feed>
