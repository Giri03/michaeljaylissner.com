iPods (and by extension, Apple) are. This is one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture below represents the folder hierarchy of my 20GB iPod, 
as displayed in the Ubuntu Disk Analyzer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="iPods Annoy Me" src="http://mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/images/ipods annoy me.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, this iPod is nearly full. I filled it with a very normal 
hodge-podge of songs. Naturally, I like some artists better than others, 
and so, I have more of their songs. &lt;em&gt;The Beatles&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Zeppelin&lt;/em&gt;, for example, 
I have a lot of. &lt;em&gt;A-Ha&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Four Non Blonds&lt;/em&gt;, not so much. When this is the 
case, I'll have a folder filled with lots of songs - a big folder. If you 
look at the image above though, you'll see that my iPod is organized into 
50 equal directories, named r1 to r50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, why would Apple do this? Why would they take perfectly organized songs
in neat and tidy folders and then split them into 50 folders with 
meaningless names? Because that makes it more of a pain in the butt to 
figure out what music is on the iPod, and in theory makes it harder to 
share the songs. For the copyright violators, this should slow them down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the world, it's a pain, because rather than browsing our 
iPod like we would a normal music player, instead we must use iTunes, or, 
if we use Linux, reverse engineer the thing, which invariably doesn't work 
that well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple could have made a device that worked normally on all computers, 
like everybody else did, but instead they have locked us into iTunes, 
a weird directory structure, and a system designed to be as obscure as 
possible. Not cool.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ipod"></category><category term="rant"></category><category term="DRM"></category></entry><entry><title>Cheney is so shady, it pisses me off.</title><link href="http://mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/12/19/cheney-is-so-fing-shady-it-pisses-me-off/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-12-19T21:35:28+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2008-12-19:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/12/19/cheney-is-so-fing-shady-it-pisses-me-off/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cheney is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jz2z92QFdgFrIMAJC-4GQcHOm3MgD955ETCO0"&gt;at work&lt;/a&gt; to keep his records from becoming public as part of 
the National Archives when he goes out of office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vice president alone may determine what constitutes vice presidential
 records or personal records, how his records will be created, maintained, 
 managed and disposed, and are all actions that are committed to his 
 discretion by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of no reason why this would be necessary unless he's the shadiest 
person ever in office. Oh, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an ex-government worker, I can testify to how ridiculous this is: It's 
really fucking ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rant"></category><category term="archive"></category><category term="cheney"></category><category term="government"></category></entry><entry><title>I Am Me, Dammit!</title><link href="http://mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/09/15/i-am-me-dammit/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-09-15T15:00:30+02:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2008-09-15:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/09/15/i-am-me-dammit/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, it happened. The bastards stole my identity. They somehow got my credit 
card number, address, phone number, etc, took them, and put them to use. Grand 
total losses: $309. Not too bad, considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've called my credit card company, and they promise to reimburse me for my 
losses. This is when I thank the federal government for making them do this. 
Thank you feds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about how this happened, and I have a theory. I am about 95% sure 
this happened as a result of shopping for car parts online. One of the 
retailers I went to (lost to me now) decided to share my contact information 
with a number of "partners" so that a part I was looking for could be found 
more easily. I ended up getting the part, but I think they might have shared 
more info than they should have. Arg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of the services that credit cards have tried to sell me over the 
years to protect me from this kind of thing, I'm happy to say that I'm fine 
without them. It's really not the end of the world...it's annoying though, yes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rant"></category><category term="theft"></category><category term="bastard"></category><category term="identity"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Amazon Has mp3's! I Wish I Could Download Them...</title><link href="http://mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/22/amazon-has-mp3s/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-22T19:04:40+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2008-01-22:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/22/amazon-has-mp3s/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It made some headlines, and is about to make more during superbowl. 
&lt;a href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9848258-7.html?tag=newsmap"&gt;Amazon 
has started selling mp3's from all four of the major record labels.&lt;/a&gt; It's a 
pretty cool revelation, so I went ahead and checked it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what? Linux users, you are screwed. In order to download albums from 
Amazon, you must "Get the Amazon mp3 downloader"...which is not available for 
Linux. Excuse me? Say what? I have downloaded literally hundreds upon hundreds 
of files from the Internet, and never have I needed a special tool other than 
Firefox. Why now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, if you're going to do something great like this, do it whole hog. 
Don't make me install junkware. After all, I'm &lt;i&gt;choosing&lt;/i&gt; to give you 
money, right? &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category><category term="copyright"></category><category term="amazon"></category><category term="rant"></category></entry></feed>
