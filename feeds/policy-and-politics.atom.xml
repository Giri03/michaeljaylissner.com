This means that it's easy to influence the vote by calling in and expressing your opinion. It's simple to do so, and more voices could change the direction of the Boy Scouts of America, allowing all boys to be included and accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scouting.org/LocalCouncilLocator.aspx"&gt;Find your local council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give them a call or send them an email telling them your opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact the national council via email: &lt;a href="mailto:feedback@scouting.org"&gt;feedback@scouting.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important is to contact your local council. We need their phones to be ringing off the hook with people expressing their opinions. It truly takes no more than two minutes. Here's the San Diego council: (619) 298-6121, and the East Bay council: (925) 674-6100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer a form letter, you can &lt;a href="https://secure3.convio.net/hrc/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;amp;page=UserAction&amp;amp;id=1623&amp;amp;autologin=true&amp;amp;utm_term=link2&amp;amp;JServSessionIdr004=on4q7x9ly4.app304a"&gt;just do this one through the Human Rights Campaign&lt;/a&gt; (34,000 people already have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple transcript for you to follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm [calling/wrriting] to express my desire that the Boy Scouts immediately lift their ban on gays. This ban is discriminatory, outdated and pointless. Scouting teaches many great lessons to thousands of adolescents across the U.S. One lesson that Scouting should not teach is that homosexuality is somehow wrong or means for discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 3rd, I hope that you will help the BSA finally makes the right decision so it can continue to lead boys into being mature and accepting men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send this to the email above, and call your local council. This could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="howto"></category><category term="homosexuality"></category><category term="boy scouts"></category></entry><entry><title>Further privacy protections at CourtListener</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2012/04/27/further-privacy-protections-at-courtlistener/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-04-27T17:05:21-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2012-04-27:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2012/04/27/further-privacy-protections-at-courtlistener/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2012/01/16/respecting-privacy-while-providing-hundreds-of-thousands-of-public-documents/"&gt;written previously&lt;/a&gt; about the lengths we go to at CourtListener to
 protect people's privacy, and today we completed one more privacy enhancement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my last post on this topic, we discovered that although we had 
already blocked cases from appearing in the search results of all major 
search engines, we had a privacy leak in the form of our computer-readable 
sitemaps. These sitemaps contain links to every page within a website, 
and since those links contain the names of the parties in a case, 
it's possible that a Google search for the party name could turn up results
 that should be hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was problematic, and as of now we have changed the way we serve 
sitemaps so that they use the noindex X-Robots-Tag HTTP header. This tells 
search crawlers that they are welcome to read our sitemaps, 
but that they should avoid serving them or indexing them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="sitemaps.xml"></category><category term="privacy"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="courtlistener.com"></category></entry><entry><title>The abolishment of the Emergency Court of Appeals (April 18, 1962)</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2011/08/10/the-abolishment-of-the-emergency-court-of-appeals-1962/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-08-10T20:50:54-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2011-08-10:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2011/08/10/the-abolishment-of-the-emergency-court-of-appeals-1962/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the coming features at &lt;a href="http://courtlistener.com"&gt;CourtListener&lt;/a&gt; is an API for the law. Part of that feature is going to be some basic information about the courts themselves, so I spent some time over the weekend researching courts that served a special purpose but were since abolished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such court was the &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Emergency_Court_of_Appeals"&gt;Emergency Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;. It was created during World War II to set prices, and, naturally, was the court of appeals for many cases. The creation date of the court is prominently published in various places on the Internet, but the abolishment history of the court was very difficult to find. After researching online for some time, and learning that my library card had expired (sigh), I put in a query with the &lt;a href="http://www.loc.gov"&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt;, which provides free research of these types of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a couple days, the provided me with this amazing response, 
 which I'm sharing here, and on the above Wikipedia article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated in the Legislative Notes to 50 U.S. Code Appendix § 921 to 926, 
as posted at http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50a/usc_sec_50a_00000921----000-notes.html, 
the following explanation is given regarding the amendment and repeal of Act 
of Jan. 30, 1942, ch. 26, title II, § 204, 56 Stat. 23, 31-33: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Section 924, acts Jan. 30, 1942, ch. 26, title II, § 204, 
56 Stat. 31; June 30, 1944, ch. 325, title I, § 107, 58 Stat. 639; June 30, 
1945, ch. 214, § 6, 59 Stat. 308; July 30, 1947, ch. 361, title I, § 101, 
61 Stat. 619; June 25, 1948, ch. 646, § 32(a), 62 Stat. 991; May 24, 1949, 
ch. 139, § 127, 63 Stat. 107, authorized review of orders of the Office of 
Price Administrator under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 
and created the Emergency Court of Appeals for this purpose. The Emergency 
Price Control Act of 1942 terminated on June 30, 1947, 
under the provisions of act July 25, 1946, ch. 671, § 1, 
60 Stat. 664. The Housing and Rent Act of 1948, act Mar. 30, 1948, ch. 161, 
62 Stat. 93, classified to section 1881 of this Appendix, 
continued the Court for the purpose of reviewing recommendations of local 
advisory boards for the decontrol or adjustment of maximum rents. Later, 
the Defense Production Act of 1950, act Sept. 8, 1950, ch. 932, 
64 Stat. 798, classified to sections 2061 to 2166 of this Appendix, 
continued the Court to review regulations and orders relating to price 
control. The Housing and Rent Act of 1948 and the Defense Production Act of 
1950 both terminated, however, the Court remained in existence "to complete 
the adjudication of rights and liabilities incurred prior to their 
termination dates." (Transcript of Proceedings of the Final Session of the 
Court, 299 F.2d 1.) The final decision of the Court, Rosenzweig v. General 
Services Administration, 1961, 299 F.2d 22, was decided on Dec. 6, 
1961. A petition for rehearing was denied on Jan. 2, 1962, 
and a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United 
States was denied on Mar. 19, 1962, 82 S. Ct. 830. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order of Chief Judge Albert B. Maris, set forth in 299 F.2d 20, 
provided: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business of this Court having been completed, it is ordered that at the
expiration of 30 days from this date, if a petition for certiorari has not 
been filed in the Supreme Court in Case No. 676 [Rosenzweig v. General 
Services Administration], just decided, the acting clerk shall deliver the 
records and papers of the Court in his office to the General Services 
Administration for permanent custody as records of the Government, 
and shall thereupon inform the Chief Justice of the United States that the 
work of the Court has been completed and that the designations of the judges
 of the Court may therefore appropriately be terminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a petition for certiorari is filed in Case No. 676 this order shall take
effect and be carried out at the expiration of 30 days after the final 
disposition of Case No. 676.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the terms of this order, the petition for certiorari 
having been filed, and denied Mar. 19, 1962, the Court terminated on Apr. 18, 1962." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

like this: You want to start a new project studying &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; dump of 
data, and you have a great idea of how to do &lt;strong&gt;Y&lt;/strong&gt; with it. You 
go download the data, but then you spend hours (days and weeks) manipulating 
it, manicuring it, and stuffing it neatly into a database. The problem is that 
the data is in &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; format, and they probably haven't told you much 
about it, much less put it into a useful format for other people. You have no 
option but to figure it out, optimize it, make it queryable, etc, when really, 
what you wish you were doing was simply &lt;em&gt;working with it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the data format and quality keeps you from working with the 
data itself. I've run into this a number of times, most notably when trying to 
work with the &lt;a href="http://www.recovery.gov/FAQ/Pages/DownLoadCenter.aspx"&gt;Recovery 
Data&lt;/a&gt;. I've also had fun working with &lt;a href="http://census.gov"&gt;census 
data&lt;/a&gt;, geographic data, and the list goes on. There are any number of useful 
data sources that are provided by non-profits and government bodies, such as 
population, economic, health, and agricultural data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem is simple. A community needs to be built around 
curating the data and providing it in useful formats, and a repository of some 
sort needs to be made so people can download &lt;em&gt;and install&lt;/em&gt; the data. 
Similar ideas have come up a few times in various formats. Most notably, 
Google has taken a stab at solving this with their &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/home" 
target="_blank"&gt;public data sets&lt;/a&gt;, and back around the turn of the 
millennium, Debian &lt;a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=38902" 
target="_blank"&gt;considered making a repository&lt;/a&gt; for the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of these solutions are good enough though. In Google's case, they're 
providing a one-way street: They choose the data source, they tune-up the 
data, and they provide the data. If there's a source you don't like, or if 
it's in a format you don't like, well, too bad. In the case of Debian, they 
decided not to go for it, but they should have. They had the right idea, but 
weren't prepared to give the idea its due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right solution will be one in which the community can suggest and debate 
data sources, and which treats the data with the respect it deserves. I think 
we'll see a data source like this eventually, but I fear that until we do, 
researchers around the world will be stuck doing unnecessary data 
transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="recovery"></category><category term="Project idea"></category><category term="debian"></category><category term="data"></category><category term="curation"></category></entry><entry><title>The eBook Wars Continue, but The Gravy Train Hasn't Arrived</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/07/24/the-ebook-wars-continue-but-the-gravy-train-has-not-arrived/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-07-24T17:15:23-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2010-07-24:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/07/24/the-ebook-wars-continue-but-the-gravy-train-has-not-arrived/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Friends, I hate to be a wet towel, but do us all a favor: Don't buy an ebook reader yet. I know, I know, Amazon just dropped the price of the Kindle by like 30% or something, which is very cool, but better things are coming if we vote with our feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current eBook readers that are on the market are gaining steam rapidly, and, yes, the devices are actually pretty cool, but there are some real problems with what we're being offered. Today, I read that &lt;a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/07/22/amazon-strikes-sweet-exclusive-deal-good-for-them-bad-for-consumers/"&gt;Amazon just signed an exclusivity deal with a publisher,&lt;/a&gt; guaranteeing that the books by that publisher will only be distributed in paper and to the Kindle. This means that if you have any other eBook reader, you will have to buy the book in print, and won't be able to download it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably don't think this is a big deal, just as you didn't think buying CDs was a big deal ten years ago, but if you're like me, these days you consider buying CDs to be old school, and would rather sit at home and buy the MP3 over the Internet. Downloading MP3s has become easier than buying CDs, and similarly, in another couple years, buying eBooks will be most people's preferred method of getting a book &amp;mdash; that is, if we have certain freedoms when buying electronic books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal Amazon just signed is going to prompt the competition to try to make similar deals with other publishers, with the result being a fractured market for eBooks. If you want this book, you have to have a Kindle. If you want that book, you have to have a Nook. Etc. Right now, that isn't too annoying since eBooks aren't yet that popular, but once eBooks become the norm, this is going to get more and more frustrating for all of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this problem, there are other issues with the current eBook ecosystem. For me to switch to using and buying eBooks, I want to be able to do the same things that I can do with real books. I want to be able to share them with my friends. I want them to be in a format that I can keep for decades, read again at a later date, and give to my children. I want to be able to bookmark and underline things, and use them on multiple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some movements towards these directions, but until Amazon stops with the exclusivity deals, and all the other eBook readers stop with their locked down devices, it looks like I'll be voting with my wallet, and staying out of the game. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="nook"></category><category term="kindle"></category><category term="ebook"></category><category term="content"></category></entry><entry><title>Project Idea: "Bug Trackers for Cities."</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/06/22/project-idea-bug-tracker-for-cities/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-06-22T16:59:02-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2010-06-22:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/06/22/project-idea-bug-tracker-for-cities/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, today's project idea was to post about the use of bug trackers for the management of city problems, but as it should turn out, I'm behind the curve on this one, so I'll just explain the concept, and post some links to people that have live implementations or have already blogged about this. When I first researched this idea about six months ago, I didn't find anything, but it seems that steam is building behind this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the idea is this: Cities have problems that citizens know about such as potholes, busted lampposts, gang activity, etc. They want to report these things to the city, but unfortunately reporting the problems by the phone or navigating the city websites is usually an awful, time-consuming, and unrewarding experience. It goes like this: First you get bumped from one department to another, eventually finding somebody who seems like they care. You tell them about the problem and feel satisfied that you've done your part, but you don't know if it's really in their system, or when it's going to get fixed or anything. You hang up the phone, and the problem is still a part of your daily life. You know if you call again, you won't be able to get an update, and you resign yourself to simply &lt;em&gt;hoping&lt;/em&gt; that the problem will eventually be resolved. The next time you notice something that's in need of fixing, you're less likely to try to help. As this goes on, eventually the people that once cared no longer do, and getting residents of a city engaged in the problems in their community becomes increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the software world, there is a similar phenomenon, except instead of infrastructure and safety problems, the problems are errors in the software that need to be fixed &amp;ndash; bugs. The solution to getting these bugs triaged and managed is to use what's known as a &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Bug_tracking_system"&gt;bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;. These systems allow the programmers behind the software to respond to problems that people find, and to triage them appropriately. In addition, they allow other people to vote on bugs, and help solve them. They allow careful prioritization of the bugs, and they allow visualizations of the bugs to be created such as the speed that they are fixed by department, the oldest bug in the system, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If such as system were used for citizens to track problems they find in their city, it would have all kinds of benefits, and indeed a few such systems have been created. The most popular that I have found is called &lt;a href="http://seeclickfix.com/"&gt;SeeClickFix&lt;/a&gt;, and looking at &lt;a href="http://seeclickfix.com/berkeley"&gt;the page for Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like it is a system that is at least used by Berkeley residents. Another popular one is &lt;a href="http://www.fixmystreet.com/"&gt;http://www.fixmystreet.com/&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, for the system to be truly effective, it would have to be endorsed by the city itself, and used by its employees as well, which is something I have yet to find an example of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people have also &lt;a href="http://speedbird.wordpress.com/2010/04/22/frameworks-for-citizen-responsiveness/"&gt;written about this idea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://portlandwiki.org/CivicApps#Notes_from_CivicApps_Meetup_at_Open_Source_Bridge_2010"&gt;Portland appears to be considering it&lt;/a&gt;, so it seems this idea is ripe on the vine and ready to be picked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question now is what will it take to implement it correctly, and what system will be the one that gains usage. I fully expect to see more cities using this type of technology in the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="urban development"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="bugs"></category><category term="Project idea"></category></entry><entry><title>Berkman Broadband Study</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/03/15/berkman-broadband-study/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-03-15T22:18:06-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2010-03-15:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/03/15/berkman-broadband-study/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last month the Berkman Center at Harvard, under the guidance of Yokai Benkler, published a &lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/pubrelease/broadband/"&gt;200+ page document&lt;/a&gt; describing the broadband situation in the United States.

&lt;p&gt;While working on the exam, I have found some real legal gems today. These 
kinds of things don't often turn up unless you know to look for them, and 
since I'm betting nobody ever looks, I figured I'd share them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, a warm up. May I present the laws that protects the &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000706----000-.html"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00220506----000-.html"&gt;The Olympics&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;And finally, those laws that &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sup_01_36_06_I_08_A_10_5.html"&gt;govern the inauguration&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000504----000-.html"&gt;the regulations of the electricity&lt;/a&gt; that day.&lt;/li&gt;

The professor for this class is the same as the one that taught the Cyberlaw class I took in the Spring, and once again, he has asked us to work on Wikipedia as part of our classwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to choose an article on Wikipedia that was related to the class, and I chose to work on the article on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobsen_v._Katzer"&gt;Jacobsen v. Katzer&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very important case as it relates to open source licensing, patent law, copyright, DMCA, and just about every other possible IP law issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it was a very complicated case because Katzer has attempted to throw the book at Jacobsen (and vice versa). The court has not yet resolved all the issues, but from reading through about half of the court documents that &lt;a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/k/docket/index.shtml"&gt;Jacobsen has posted&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that Katzer has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patented technology that was not his to patent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempted to get licensing fees from Jacobsen for those patents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stolen the intellectual property of an open source project, stripped it of its license and then incorporated it into his own commercial project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempted to sue Jacobsen for copyright violation for something - I'm not even sure what&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And more - see the article for details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it's a nasty, nasty case, but ultimately it should work out for Jacobsen, and he should come out the better (or at least none the worse). At a minimum, he has to prove that the patents are invalid, Katzer stole his IP, and that he didn't steal Katzer's IP - a walk in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, that's easier said than done, but he's fighting what appears to be the good fight, and it looks like if he keeps at it, he will win in the end.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="patent"></category><category term="paper"></category><category term="open source"></category><category term="Jacobsen v.

Today I completed the final paper 
for &lt;a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i205/s09/index.html"&gt;my class on information law and policy&lt;/a&gt;, which was one of my best 
classes this semester. It was a pretty tough one that required a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of 
reading and a lot of extra work for the assignments, but I found it quite 
rewarding in the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="{filenames}/pdfs/online-estates.pdf"&gt;attached assignment&lt;/a&gt; is in a similar vein to the one I posted on 
Tuesday, but approaches the topic from a slightly different angle. The assignment in 
this case was to present an analysis of some of the policy problems that are 
raised by a project of our choice. Since I had already done a lot of thinking 
about the policy implications of how we handle online assets after a death, I 
decided to analyze some of the problems that are raised, and to postulate some 
solutions of my own.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thanatosensitivity"></category><category term="paper"></category></entry><entry><title>Final Paper on Online Memorialization by Default</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/05/13/final-paper-on-online-memorialization-by-default/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-05-13T11:25:10-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2009-05-13:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/05/13/final-paper-on-online-memorialization-by-default/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had an epic writing session, and finished &lt;a href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/online-grieving.pdf"&gt;my final paper&lt;/a&gt; for
my class on the social and organizational issues of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of my paper was a bit on the morbid side, but somehow that's what
 I'm doing a lot of work on this semester. The concept for the paper is 
 that as more and more people create and have online profiles on social 
 networking sites, a system is created where more and more people have an 
 online memorial when they die, whether they intend to or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic became interesting to me about a year ago when my friend Blake 
Bigler died of a sudden heart attack (at the age of 25). Immediately 
afterwards, his Facebook page became a memorial to him where friends posted
 messages, pictures and the like. To this day, friends still wish him a 
 happy birthday, and post notes on his page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that this was a dramatic change to the way that deaths occur and 
are memorialized, and that it needed to be analyzed more carefully, 
and so my paper was born.

This weeks' big news is that a number of memos authorizing, rationalizing and generally condoning torture and interrogation &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&amp;ncl=1334762857&amp;topic=h"&gt;have been released to the ACLU&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a couple of interesting facts here.  The first is that &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; few of the 3,000 or so news articles about this topic seem to link to the &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/olc_memos.html"&gt;ACLU site where the memos are prominently featured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I find this odd, and it gives me plenty of room for speculation. (Bad reporting? Laziness? Suppression? Something else?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second interesting thing is the quotes in the memos themselves. I haven't had a chance to read all the memos yet, but I didn't have any difficulty finding some good stuff. The memos begin with a classic "Top Secret" stamp, and go on to say things such as:&lt;blockquote&gt;...You would like to employ ten techniques...These ten techniques are: (1) attention grasp, (2) Walling, (3) facial hold, (4) facial slap (insult slap), (5) cramped confinement, (6) wall standing, (7) stress positions, (8) sleep deprivation, (9) insects placed in a confinement box, and (10) the waterboard&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From a different memo:&lt;blockquote&gt;Detainees subject to sleep deprivation who are also subject to nudity as a separate interrogation technique will at times be nude and wearing a diaper. If the detainee is wearing a diaper, it is checked regularly and changed as necessary...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They go on from there with great detail about how the interrogations go down, with the conclusion of course being that these things don't constitute torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The math was done crudely. &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&amp;ncl=1334762857&amp;topic=h"&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; a google search that turns up 2,890 hits on the topic, and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;num=20&amp;q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.aclu.org%2Fsafefree%2Fgeneral%2Folc_memos.html+interrogation+memo&amp;btnG=Search"&gt;here's&lt;/a&gt; one that searches for sites that link to aclu.org, and that have the words "interrogation memo".

handle and cope with real life death, and I found a good quote today. It's 
not exactly about the Internet and death, but it's interesting to think 
about ways the Interne  may have made relationships more complex and how 
that has affected who is socially allowed to grieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=memorializing%20loved%20ones%20on%20the%20world%20wide%20web"&gt;Memorializing Loved Ones on the World Wide 
Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are unwritten but familiar rules, however, about who is entitled to
grieve. Pine, for example, claimed that in "compartmentalized society, 
funerals tend to be limited primarily to the 'proper' bereaved people. This
has helped to create an underclass of grievers whose legitimacy may not 
even be recognized and whose needs are not addressed." Doka (1989) 
identified these individuals as disenfranchised grievers: those whose grief
occurs in relationships with no recognizable kin ties; those whose loss is 
not socially defined as significant; and those who are perceived to be 
incapable of grief (e.g., young children, very old adults, 
mentally-disabled persons)...As relationships become more complex, 
the likelihood of disenfranchised grief and disenfranchised death increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As somebody who has lost a couple of friends over the years that I was 
fairly close to (but not best friends with), this definitely hits home.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="digital death"></category><category term="online grief"></category><category term="mourning"></category></entry><entry><title>An Analysis of FTC Behavioral Advertising and an End of Semester Countdown</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/04/02/analysis-of-ftc-behavioral-advertising/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-04-02T14:44:40-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2009-04-02:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/04/02/analysis-of-ftc-behavioral-advertising/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's coming down to the end of the semester, and after I finished &lt;a href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/ftc.pdf"&gt;the

&lt;p&gt;I chose to flesh out the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeran_v._America_Online,_Inc."&gt;Zeran v. AOL&lt;/a&gt; article, and man was it a lot of work. You take for granted the amount of labor that goes into a Wikipedia article until you write one yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case itself is pretty interesting, if I do say so myself. It's one of the main cases that granted immunity to websites from the postings of third parties. What happened was that somebody posted some inflammatory T-shirts on an AOL bulletin board in 1995, and put down Kenneth Zeran's name and phone number. He got hundreds of phone calls threatening and berating him, and decided to sue AOL as a result for distributing defamatory materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Zeran though, between the time that the materials were posted, and the time that he sued, Congress passed the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act"&gt;Communications Decency Act&lt;/a&gt;, which pretty much covers AOL's back (and google's, and yahoo's, and youtube's, and pretty much everybody else's).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sucks to be Zeran, but in the words of &lt;a href="http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/02/cyber/cyberlaw/04law.html"&gt;one article on the subject&lt;/a&gt;, "It...illustrates a hard fact of life: Sometimes there is no legal remedy for those who suffer wrongs."&lt;/p&gt;

I had embarrassingly weak knowledge of politics, and didn't vote in the election despite some people getting rather annoyed with me about it. I argued at the time (and I stand by this), that people should only vote if they know enough to vote the right way. At the time, I felt like I didn't know enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to remember how things were back then. Bush was obviously an idiot, but at the same time, it wasn't obvious how much damage he would do (or that somehow he'd last eight years). My first hint that he was terrible was his thinking on stem cells, which pretty indisputably slowed medicine research for about a decade. Once I heard about this issue, I knew I should have voted, and became fairly active reading the news and learning the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, I can thank the Bush administration for being one of the most corrupt, damaging, and all-around God-awful regimes in American history. If it hadn't been so terrible, I might not have gotten so interested. I think this is true for many of my friends as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just spent some time looking at a few of &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing_room/executive_orders/"&gt;Obama's executive orders and memos&lt;/a&gt;, and of the few I read, it's pretty impressive. It's been less than a week, and suddenly I'm having a lot more trouble being critical of the administration. If I'm not supposed to rag on Bush anymore, in a way, what do I do? Do I praise Obama? That's not really my style. Maybe I should be critical of the Obama administration? But there's not a lot to be too critical of just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a bit confused, in a good way.

called &lt;a href="www.lessig.org/content/articles/works/finalhls.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 
Law of the Horse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he writes about how code can control law, and 
vise versa. He makes some good points that are intuitive yet bear saying 
nonetheless. Cyberspace as it currently exists is a largely unregulated domain. 
People can use it pretty much anonymously, so accountability is pretty limited. 
Lessig argues that this is because of the architecture of the Internet as it 
has been created by programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Net grows, as its 
regulatory power increases, as its power as a source of values becomes 
established, the values of real-space sovereigns will at first lose out. In 
many cases, no doubt, that is a very good thing. But there is no reason to 
believe that it will be a good thing generally or indefinitely. There is 
nothing to guarantee that the regime of values constituted by code will be a 
liberal regime; and little reason to expect that an invisible hand of code 
writers will push it in that direction. Indeed, to the extent that code 
writers respond to the wishes of commerce, a power to control may well be the 
tilt that this code begins to take. Understanding this tilt will be a&lt;br /&gt;
continuing project of the law of cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in other words, cyberspace is a good place these days, ruled by fairly 
liberal ideals, but there is no guarantee that it will stay that way, and we 
may eventually need more regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="infotech"></category><category term="cyberlaw"></category><category term="Lessig"></category></entry><entry><title>Guantanamo to Close, But They're Just Moving the Prisoners</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/01/12/guantanamo-to-close-but-they-are-just-moving-the-prisoners/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-12T23:17:53-08:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2009-01-12:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/01/12/guantanamo-to-close-but-they-are-just-moving-the-prisoners/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was happy to read the news today that &lt;a href="http://www.iht

plans to close Guantanamo Bay prison camp&lt;/a&gt;. This is good news for 
America, and should be good news for the prisoners there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read up on it though, I was saddened to hear that the prisoners are 
just being moved to other countries. This is rather frustrating because as Noam Chomsky puts it &amp;mdash; and I'm paraphrasing &amp;mdash; there's only one reason to have off-site &lt;del&gt;torture&lt;/del&gt; prison camps: to go around American law.&lt;/p&gt;

 moving the prisoners elsewhere. Pretty stupid use of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have conferred with transition officials said the incoming 
administration appeared to have rejected a proposal to seek a new law 
authorizing indefinite detention inside the United States. The Bush 
administration has insisted that such a measure is necessary to close the 
Guantanamo camp and bring some detainees to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we could bring the prisoners to a camp in the U.S., 
but that would mean we couldn't hold them in tiny cells indefinitely, 
and that American law would be necessary. Wow. Can't have that, can we?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="torture"></category><category term="prison camp"></category><category term="Obama"></category><category term="Cuba"></category></entry><entry><title>Research Idea – The Age of the Internet</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/01/05/research-idea-age-of-the-internet/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-05T15:41:47-08:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2009-01-05:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/01/05/research-idea-age-of-the-internet/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I blogged &lt;a href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/12/28/firefox-last-modified-tip/"&gt;a while back&lt;/a&gt; about a Firefox command that would tell you

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Gore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applaud your efforts towards educating the world on the subject of 
anthropogenic climate change, and I congratulate you on your Nobel Prize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write today to urge you to adopt a more open copyright on your materials. 
From what I can deduce, you are relying on the standard American copyright 
for your movie, presentations and books. As a lawyer, 
I am sure you are aware that this copyright system gives you incredible 
strength to protect the fruit of your efforts, however for many people, 
this system hampers their access to reading your books, 
watching your movie, or enjoying your presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and the IPCC have been recognized as the greatest laborers towards 
educating the world on this subject, and I understand if you have taken the 
traditional route with your work. Recently however, as I began purchasing 
the third copy of your movie to give away to a friend, 
I couldn't help but think about how great it would be if it were simply 
streamed from your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many options for creating a more open copyright system, 
and I hope you will take the time to consider the implications of your 
current method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes to be Silent is to Lie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;Miguel de Unamuno&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Steele:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was four years old, I was a Tiger Scout. Later, I became a Cub Scout,
 and then a Webelos. When I was old enough, I became a Boy Scout. Over the 
 next few years, I advanced in rank, became an Eagle Scout and achieved many
  Eagle Palms. I had over 100 merit badges, was the Junior Assistant 
  Scoutmaster, went on the National Jamboree in Arlington, Virginia, 
  and the International Jamboree in Chile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was what could be considered one hell of a Boy Scout. Today, 
with much bitterness and sadness, I give up the only remaining symbol of 
those parts of my life. Today, I return to you my Eagle Scout Badge, 
and in so doing, renounce and reject the prejudices and discriminative 
practices of the Boy Scouts of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was about 16, I learned that agnostics, atheists and gays would not 
be tolerated by the policies of the Boy Scouts. While it's true that as of 
2000, the supreme court backs your (well-funded) position as a private 
organization to discriminate institutionally, that does not make it right. 
Each of these positions flies in the face of scouting elsewhere in the 
world, and each of them reinforces an environment in which people with 
different opinions are awarded different value. While it is true that Baden 
Powell said that "[no] man is much good unless he believes in God and obeys 
His laws," we sometimes must reflect on the beliefs of our founders, 
and put them in the context of their day. When Baden Powell made this 
remark, women had not yet gained suffrage, Nazi Europe had yet to come and 
go, and apartheid had yet to be institutionalized, let alone dismantled. In 
short, it was a different time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must ask ourselves what are we doing today that our children will disdain.
Today we live in a world where religious differences can be enlightening 
and can lead to greater understanding of ourselves and our peers. Yet in 
this world, religion can be used publicly as an accusation (Obama as Muslim),
and defenses to such accusations need not defend the religion, 
only the man. We live in a world today where religious differences lead to 
war, terrorism, and deaths of thousands of people. We live in a world where 
an organization designed to create leaders out of boys discriminates based 
on religion and sexual preference. If we are not careful, 
our children and their children will not look kindly upon our time as one of
freedom of opinion and religion, but rather as one of oppression, war, 
and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your organization has at its heart some of the greatest lessons I have 
learned during my lifetime, and it saddens me greatly to be forced to 
abandon it. I plan to have children one day, and it saddens me greatly that
they will not have the Boy or Girl Scouts of America in their lives. Most 
of all though, it saddens me that a national organization would choose not 
to include a diversity of people and opinions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enclosed is my Eagle Scout badge, one of my more treasured possessions. I 
hope some day to get it back from you, and I hope someday that you will 
realize the error of your ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, &lt;/p&gt;

grandparent's house. It's been a great trip, but one thing about it keeps 
plaguing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a couple of days in New Orleans, and one of the places I insisted upon 
seeing was the 9th Ward, where Katrina dealt some of the worst damage. I wanted 
to see if people were recovering, and how much the place had been fixed up 
since 2005 when the storm blew through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprised me (aside from the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bisset_linda/3026355210/"&gt;markings&lt;/a&gt;) is that people are moving 
back into this area, rebuilding their houses, and generally, pouring money into 
the location. On the one hand, it makes sense since it's their home, but on the 
other, I can't help but think that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; should stop 
this from happening. From what I've learned while here, the 9th Ward is an area 
of New Orleans that is going to flood if there is another hurricane 
Katrina...which there will be sooner or later. Considering that Katrina 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina"&gt;killed almost 2,000 
people&lt;/a&gt; this seems rather unwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, rather than moving back in, shouldn't we be cutting our losses right about 
now, finding somewhere for these people to live, and preventing another 
disaster? Or is my logic flawed?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="policy"></category><category term="katrina"></category><category term="disaster"></category><category term="bad ideas"></category></entry><entry><title>A Music Cost Inventory</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/11/22/a-music-cost-inventory/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-11-22T17:21:02-08:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2008-11-22:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/11/22/a-music-cost-inventory/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html"&gt;Title 17, Chapter 5, section 504c2 of the US copyright law&lt;/a&gt;, if you get caught with music that you have downloaded illegally from the Internet, you can get charged up to $150,000 per infringement. I thought I would do a little experiment to see how much I would be in for if my entire collection were to be found to be illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's do some math. I have 3,876 tracks, at $150,000 each. So if my entire collection were to be found illegal, that means it would cost me $581.4 million dollars &amp;mdash; about .6 billion dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, let's assume that I can live with that reality. It just seems odd that I could have bought those songs for $3,876 on amazon.com, or iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;

Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been "You are an important person just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions." Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is important.&lt;/blockquote&gt;You tell them Mr. Rogers.

In an &lt;a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iXAkBilVhjbpsgAAHfgp6kGEShvwD944BQP84"&gt;article by the AP today&lt;/a&gt;, the Republicans said that they were going to: &lt;blockquote&gt;"...send out over 200 million pieces of mail and have over a quarter of a billion contacts, counting the mail, the phones and the door knocks,"&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to the 2000 census, there are about 227 million people in the US over the age 18. What that means is that if ONLY the republican party ONLY contacted me regarding the presidential race, they would still do so more than one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, both parties contact me at all levels of government from city to county to state to federal. And they both do it for each candidate, and every measure. Often they do it more than once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They've done an excellent job showing that the figures are absolutely bogus, but their conclusion really makes quite a point. For reference, the first figure is that 750,000 jobs have been lost due to piracy, and the second is that piracy costs $200-$250 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a quote from the conclusion, after they have debunked both of the numbers:&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither figure is terribly plausible on its face. As Wired noted earlier this week, 750,000 jobs is fully 8 percent of the current number of unemployed in the United States. And $250 billion is more than the combined 2005 gross domestic revenues of the movie, music, software, and video game industries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

An example that I keep returning to is the need for encryption. I posted a few days ago about how Yahoo! doesn't encrypt their email, allowing a sophisticated hacker to intercept any message to or from your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I encountered my password in plain text in a configuration file that is easily accessible to anybody that gains physical access to my computer. The guilty program is the Pidgin IM client (&lt;a href="http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/5872"&gt;bug filed here&lt;/a&gt;), which stores login and password information in an XML file in your home directory. I've seen files of this sort a number of times, and for some reason programmers keep using this technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people believe that if they have confidential information in their computers, and if they use a password on their computer, they'll be OK. Nobody will be able to get past the password. While that isn't entirely true (most passwords are easily broken), the thing to remember is that once a hard drive is removed from a computer, any of the data on it can be accessed &amp;#8212; without the password. So, so long as programmers keep using this technique, sensitive data will still be out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest solution to this problem is to encrypt your entire hard disk at all times. That way, even if your hard disk is removed from your computer, all the data is jumbled anyway. Ubuntu released this feature back in April, and Microsoft released this feature with the release of Vista. Unfortunately though, to receive encryption on your Vista installation, you have to buy Vista Ultimate, which costs $120 more than the Home version (&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/compare-editions/default.aspx"&gt;at a cool $320!&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we trust more and more data on our computers, is this irresponsible product engineering? Absolutely. It costs Microsoft no more money to put encryption on all versions. Unfortunately though, they make more money by charging for it. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="microsoft"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="vista"></category><category term="pidgin"></category></entry><entry><title>On DRM and the Darknet</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/09/15/on-drm-and-the-darknet/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-09-15T21:09:43-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2008-09-15:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/09/15/on-drm-and-the-darknet/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just read &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcrypto.stanford.edu%2FDRM2002%2Fdarknet5.doc&amp;ei=VTLPSLfdG5m0sQOo1ciIBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHZkIYjxy6LnWvUSt6kGrZ3SYLMZQ&amp;sig2=hz865qMKNfakTgDi4sUVpA"&gt;an

the futures of darknets and illicit file sharing on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty interesting stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...the darknet will be a competitor to legal commerce. From the point of 
view of economic theory, this has profound implications for business strategy: 
for example, increased security (e.g. stronger DRM systems) may act as a
disincentive to legal commerce. Consider an MP3 file sold on a web site: this 
costs money, but the purchased object is as useful as a version acquired from 
the darknet. However, a securely DRM-wrapped song is strictly less attractive: 
although the industry is striving for flexible licensing rules, customers will 
be restricted in their actions if the system is to provide meaningful security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She was mayor of a town so small it didn't have a police department&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She believes the Iraq war is "a task from God."&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Referring to a natural gas line she wanted built, she said, "God's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built, so pray for that."&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Gods will? What? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She has been Governor of Alaska for about a year and a half. For the ten years or so prior to that, she was mayor of a TINY town of about 5,469 people.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She opposes abortion in all cases except if the health of the mother is in danger. That includes rape and incest.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of 2006, she supported teaching creationism in schools. To wit: "Teach both...I am a proponent of teaching both."&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She sued the Bush administration for listing polar bears as a threatened species.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we really want this person in any position of power? To reiterate, she was mayor of a town of about 5,000 people for the bulk of her time in politics, she believes she knows the will of God, she would have creationism in schools, she would have rape victims give birth to the rapist's child against their will, and is even more anti-environmental than the Bush administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredible. Please help get this word out. This is awful, and not just a passing concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of going to see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; last night at Cal. 
Although our fourth-row seating probably influenced my judgement, 
I must say he is a truly excellent speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished his book, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; several months ago, 
and I had to agree with a friend who said he was a bit "heavy-handed" in 
the book. So when I went to see him in person, I expected much the same. I 
expected him to push me, to drive his point, to be a little bit too 
aggressive in his delivery. To the contrary though, he is a subtle, 
interesting, humble, and actually quite a funny speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his speech, he engaged in "consciousness raising", 
which he believes worked for feminism, and which he believes will work for 
religion. His example was that as a result of feminist consciousness 
raising, if I say: "All men are created equal", you might think: "Right, 
but what about the women?" He wants to apply this tool to religion, 
so if I say: "A Catholic child", you think: "Children aren't Catholics - 
They're too young to know where they stand on such issues." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believes (and I must agree) that religion in the world has brought much 
violence and destruction, and that the whole thing could be cut off at the 
stem if we all realized that our children do not share our religion. I'm 
simplifying and combining several of his points, but that was really the 
thrust of his speech. If I am a catholic, that does not make my child a 
catholic; I a Muslim, does not make my child a Muslim. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To drive his point home, Dawkins showed a picture that he said he found on 
the Christmas cover of the UK's &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/"&gt;Telegraph Newspaper&lt;/a&gt;. In the picture, 
were three children sitting side by side in costume for some Christmas event
(I think they were the three wise men or some such). The idea behind the 
picture was to depict religious harmony. To quote his book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Christmas-time one year my daily newspaper, the Independent, 
was looking for a seasonal image and found a heart-warmingly ecumenical one
at a school nativity play. The Three Wise Men were played by, 
as the caption glowingly said, Shadbreet (a Sikh), 
Musharraf (a Muslim) and Adele (a Christian), all aged four. Charming? 
Heart-warming? No, it is not, it is neither; it is grotesque. [...] Imagine 
an identical photograph, with the caption changed as follows: "Shadbreet (a 
Keynesian), Musharaff (a Monetarist) and Adele (a Marxist), 
all aged four." Wouldn't this be a candidate for irate letters of protest? 
It certainly should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say that I'm one to really get "irate" about such things, 
but he really does have a point. The number of people that grow up to be the
same religion as their parents is astounding. How can it be that the 
religion of all peoples' parents around the world just happens to be the 
right one for their children? It defies logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Dawkins believes that if we raise consciousness in a similar way to 
feminism, and find a way to allow children to be nontheists until they are 
old enough to make such decisions on their own, we might just be able to 
beat thi  religion thing. We might be able to curb religious violence by 
allowing children to make their own choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could work, and I for one am officially convinced that I will not let 
people speak of religious children. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="atheism"></category><category term="Cal"></category></entry><entry><title>Federal Salaries</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/02/10/federal-salaries/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-02-10T12:02:17-08:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2008-02-10:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/02/10/federal-salaries/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just some food for thought from &lt;a href="http://thebudgetgraph.com"&gt;thebudgetgraph.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Call me a commie or a socialist or something if you must, but I challenge you to identify why these are not critical flaws with our system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number 1 - Money&lt;/strong&gt;
It's long been known that it's expensive to run for any political position, but how much does it really cost? Well, as of January 9, &lt;a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/01/09/clinton_fundraising_remains_st.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; says that Hillary has raised about 24 million bucks. That's pretty darned impressive, but let's take a moment to think about that. Nobody gives money for nothing, so the way I like to think about it is to say that she is 24 million dollars in debt. If she wins, she'll need to get that money back to those companies/people, and will probably do something to make that happen. Kind of like the current administration &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=com.ubuntu%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;q=halliburton+cheney+connection&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw"&gt;did for Halliburton&lt;/a&gt;, except more democratic. So we have a new president that has biases on their very first day. Great. My solution to this is a very simple concept: publicly funded elections. I know it sounds expensive, but it serves two purposes. The first is that it allows politicians that are running for office to focus on their current jobs,  rather than focusing on raising money. The second is that it levels the playing field for third parties (see number 2 below) while creating elected officials without debts to companies. What a concept!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number 2 - No Third Party&lt;/strong&gt;
This one is obvious. Does anybody vote green or independent (or other) outside of strongly democratic states? Is there a third party? No, not really, which means that it's either democrat or republican, i.e. status quo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number 3 - Nobody Knows Their Candidate&lt;/strong&gt;
It's a fact. There is so much hype around elections that pretty much everybody, including those who follow these things pretty closely don't know what their candidate stands for. What it comes down to for the democratic primary is, "Black or woman?" In the case of the republican primary it's "Military guy or mormon?" That is not how the fate of the world (voting for president) should be decided, but I bet it's about what it's coming down to. I recently was shown a site called &lt;a href="http://www.glassbooth.com"&gt;glassbooth.com&lt;/a&gt;, which asks you some questions about your opinions on issues, and then tells you how to vote so you get a candidate that agrees with your opinions. Doesn't that make more sense? Can't we have that when we vote for president? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number 4 - State Electorate System...Broken.&lt;/strong&gt;
Shall we face it yet that having our vote broken up by state electorate points doesn't make much sense? Why should our votes be broken up by artificial lines in the sand? It doesn't pass the logic test if you ask me. For example, there was a recent measure in California to redistrict the state, thus allowing a more accurate split of its points. That makes sense, but why not just do away with the whole outdated system altogether? It's time, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number 5 - Voter Ignorance/Impossibly Complicated Issues&lt;/strong&gt;
I'll be the first to admit that I don't know what most of the candidates stand for on an issue by issue basis (see number three above). I think I have some idea, but that's only after studying up, and I still feel kind of ignorant on much of it. Think about this squirrelly question: is a tax break good for the economy? How much of the population knows enough economics to understand this issue? Maybe one percent, and probably more like one percent of one percent. Yet, all of the population votes on the issue, and most of it votes depending on who has the greater advertising money, and thus the more convincing ads. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It's not a winning concept, and it can be expanded to other issues, such as stem cells, wire tapping, money for schools, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="politics"></category><category term="elections"></category></entry><entry><title>A Website that Irks My Soul, and the Internet's Inability to Kill It</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/11/19/a-website-that-irks-my-soul-and-the-internets-inability-to-kill-it/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-11-19T21:15:49-08:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2007-11-19:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/11/19/a-website-that-irks-my-soul-and-the-internets-inability-to-kill-it/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's a website a friend pointed out to me. It's called c o n s e r v o p 
e d i a, only without the spaces and with a .com at the end. It exemplifies 
so much in the world that is wrong. For example, here's the picture on the 
page entitled "Liberal":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No Alt" src="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/images/Liberal_Brain_0.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is a just a bit annoying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don't mention this to bash that site (though I hate it), 
I mention it because it exemplifies a problem of sorts with the Internet. 
The problem is this: if I want to give props to a site, 
I can do so &lt;a href="http://www.gossamergear.com"&gt;in a heartbeat by linking to it&lt;/a&gt;. A fine example of this was 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb"&gt;Google Bombing&lt;/a&gt;, while it lasted. On the other hand, 
if a website blows and I feel that it is making the world a worse place, 
all I can do is put spaces in its name and hope it becomes obscure enough to
 go away (which this one is not about to do). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine there are some rather contentious issues regarding an internet 
where websites can be voted up and down on a grander scale than digg, 
but really, if something is evil and doing harm and disservice to the world,
 there should be a way to make it more obscure than the search engine's 
 algorithm. Similarly, if a website is doing illegal stuff, 
 we should be able to get rid of it quickly and without a lot of hassle 
 (think Internet scam sites).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="infotech"></category></entry><entry><title>The Singularity Is Near</title><link href="//mlissner.github.io/michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/10/12/the-singularity-is-near/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-12T22:53:24-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:mlissner.github.io,2007-10-12:michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/10/12/the-singularity-is-near/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know what you're thinking: "The Singularity - What is Mike talking about? This must be stupid." I'm here to say that it might be stupid, but bear with me because I can't decide if it is, and I need to know the public consensus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Singularity is this theory I have been reading far too much about that there will come a time when "computers transcend biology." Think about that for a moment: computers...transcend...biology. In other words, there will come a time when computers are so advanced that they have moved beyond the limitations of biology; beyond what we now think of as computers, and into some biocomputing nano-thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book I'm reading right now is &lt;em&gt;The Singularity is Near&lt;/em&gt; by Ray Kurzweil. It sounds like a joke, and you'd think he was some two-bit writer that didn't cite his references, or that didn't know his shit, but sadly, the book has over 100 pages of references, and the man teaches at Stanford. So he's qualified to write about crazy future ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if technological change occurred at an exponentially exponential rate (crazy, I know), and that in about 33 years - give or take - we will experience the Singularity. At that point, computers will be able to build themselves. Software will write itself, and because it is being written by software that doesn't make mistakes like ordinary humans, new versions and steps forward in technology will happen so quickly that we won't be able to keep up. It sounds crazy at first, but then you start to think about it: We have programming languages, and we have Integrated Development Environments that help us mortals to write software. Is it so crazy to think that the two might merge, and that software might write itself? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes? OK, you're probably referring to the fact that computers don't have creative powers. This is true, but, like a child, they can learn language autonomously, and build themselves autonomously already. For example, out here in the Bay Area, we're near Google, who has just rolled out a new service called Goog-411. Basically, you call 1-800-Goog-411, and a machine will record your voice, ask you what location and business name. It will then (seemingly without fail), give you the phone number for the location, and connect you (for free). It's great, and what's more amazing is that the success of your call teaches the computer how to better help the next person. The more people call, the better it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we have computers that can build themselves already, and we have computers that could theoretically write themselves from the ground up. Imagine if we had computers that could analyze the news, and attempt to fix problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above seems plausible to me, more or less. I mean, forty years ago, we didn't even have computers. Now we have ones that can write the &lt;a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/pipermail/genome/2000-July/000021.html"&gt;entire human genome on a CD&lt;/a&gt;, or if you prefer, it can do it eight or nine times on a DVD.  That's all the information needed to create a human. On a CD. Is it so crazy to believe that computers will be able to do what we humans can? I'm not so skeptical any more. Will the timing be around 2040...I think it may. Freaky.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="singularity"></category><category term="book"></category><category term="infotech"></category></entry></feed>
